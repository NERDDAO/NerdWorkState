# Proof-of-Knowledge Mechanism in DeSciWorld Protocol 

The DeSciWorld protocol employs a unique mechanism called "Proof-of-Knowledge" (PoK) for incentivizing and valuing knowledge contributions within the DeSciWorld ecosystem. The PoK works in tandem with blockchain technology and advanced AI to effectively validate knowledge and equitably distribute rewards among the participants. 

## PoK Mechanism Structure

* **Knowledge Submission**: The first phase begins when users, referred to as "Nerds", submit a Study Question (SQ). This SQ serves as a fundamental unit of information that forms the base for a potential knowledge tree. Each SQ is tagged with a unique NFT, representing its ownership, attributing it to the correct author, and recording its existence on the blockchain.

* **Knowledge Creation**:  As the research progress, Nerds contribute individual units of knowledge, called "Engrams". Each Engram represents a unique piece of knowledge tied to the original SQ.

* **Knowledge Processing**: These Engrams are then processed by "kNeurons", artificially intelligent agents within the DeSciWorld ecosystem. kNeurons validate and interlink Engrams, and each Engram's value and relevance are computed based on certain pre-set parameters, such as - correctness, novelty, relevance, etc.

* **Knowledge Validation**: When a certain threshold of Engrams has been accumulated under an SQ, independent Validators then assess the gathered knowledge for its relevance, accuracy, completeness, and progress. They verify the information against quality benchmarks and existing knowledge within the ecosystem.

* **Proof-of-Knowledge Execution**: Following the validation phase, the PoK mechanism tracks the lifecycle of each SQ, logging interactions, value attribution events and initiates reward distribution. 

* **Value Attribution and Reward Distribution**: All interactions with an SQ or its Engrams are collected and utilized in the computation of value. The popularity of an SQ, measured through views, citations, or usage in new research, contributes to its value accumulation. The corresponding rewards are then distributed back to the original owner or significant knowledge contributors.

* **Continual Value Attribution**: The royalty mechanism continues to function as long as the SQ and associated Engrams are interacted with. As new research and knowledge build upon previous work, the original contributors continue to accumulate value, ensuring that contributions to the ecosystem are continuously incentivized.

## PoK Mechanism Implementation

To implement the PoK mechanism, the DeSciWorld protocol relies heavily on blockchain technology. Each step of the PoK process, from SQ submission to reward distribution, is recorded immutably onto the DeSciWorld blockchain. This ensures transparency, fraud-resistance and trustlessness within the ecosystem.

Smart contracts execute most of the logic of the PoK mechanism on the blockchain. These self-executing contracts automate the procedures, reducing the need for a central authority and allowing the system to operate in a truly decentralized manner.

Moreover, advanced AI and Machine Learning algorithms are used in the processing and validation stages. These computational models are adept at dealing with vast volumes of complex knowledge structures and can efficiently rank and value them based upon a multitude of parameters.

## Conclusion

The Proof-of-Knowledge mechanism is designed to leverage the power of blockchain technology to create a decentralized knowledge sharing and validation ecosystem. This ensures that each "Nerd" is rewarded for their contributions, which are validated, attributed value, and preserved on an immutable blockchain. In this way, the ecosystem nurtures a self-sustaining and ever-evolving knowledge-based network.
