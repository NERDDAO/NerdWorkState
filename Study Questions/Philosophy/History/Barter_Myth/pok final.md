>[!intro] Proof of Knowledge
>The DeSciWorld protocol makes use of a distinctive mechanism termed "Proof-of-Knowledge" (PoK). This mechanism incentivizes, validates, and assigns value to participantsâ€™ knowledge contributions in the DeSciWorld ecosystem. Employing blockchain technology and advanced AI, PoK effectively validates knowledge, assigns it value, and ensures fair reward distribution among the participating entities
## Definitions
>[!cue]
>- **Study Question (SQ)**: A base query submitted by a user that forms the foundation of a potential knowledge tree
>- **Engram**: The fundamental unit of knowledge represented as a tree of notes.
>- **kNeuron**: Distinct groups of instructions that perform a task within an engram.

## PoK Mechanism Structure

* **Question Creation**: Participants  present Study Questions (SQ) which form the basis for the creation of knowledge trees. Study questions serve as the coordination point for the creation of Engrams. Questions behave like unique erc-20 tokens that grant the holder specific rights.

* These knowledge trees link to engrams, the fundamental unit of information. Every submitted SQ generates a unique token ID that attaches to every related Engram NFT (Non-Fungible Token) produced under the research question, thereby preserving its provenance, ownership, and correct attribution.

* **kNeuron Processing & Knowledge Validation**: 
* Functionally Engrams emerge from the interaction between SQs, kNeurons and the research data. 
* The role of kNeurons is twofold: 
	* To aid the researcher in the processing of unstructured information. 
	* To allow DeSciWorld to verify the engrams through the application of standardized kNeurons which can be designed to act as a "rule of thumb" and apply instructions at scale.

* In other words, the kNeurons process the newly submitted SQ into a brand new and coherent Engram. Using their profile and purpose as instructions, they examine the authenticity, value, quality, and novelty of the information and allow for recursive generation of insights. By ensuring local coherence we can extrapolate to large scale complex understanding of the overall context presented. and the generation of novel knowledge.

* **Proof-of-Knowledge Execution**: Newly created engrams are automatically available for query using the indexing contract. This allows the metadata associated to be embedded into the vector search engine that will be able to utilize the engram as part of its responses, By tracking these queries we can attribute value to each engram depending on the relevance for the service provided. Key events, validation, and interactions recorded during this process guide the value attribution and rewards as determined by PoK. An AI-based algorithm considers various factors such as views, upvotes, citations and content quality to assign value points that convert into rewards for the original creator and any significant Engram contributors.

* **Value Attribution and Reward Distribution**: On a rolling basis inflation from the DeSciWorld token will be paid out to the SQs based on their score. This allows users to obtain royalties from participating in the creation of knowledge and clears up the provenance of the data produced by AI services. 

* **Continual Value Attribution**: As new knowledge continually builds upon previous work, the related SQ retains its ability to acquire value with each interaction. This encourages active participation and contribution from Users.

## PoK Mechanism Implementation

Blockchain technology provides the core framework for implementing the PoK mechanism. Key steps in the PoK process, such as SQ submission, kNeuron processing, event notification, updates on SQ state, and reward distribution are executed via secure and transparent smart contracts.

This end-to-end process, from initial submission to ongoing validation and reward, harnesses blockchain's immutability, transparency, and decentralization, alongside advanced AI and machine learning. Together they underpin meticulous knowledge verification, efficient quality control, reputation management, smart linkage establishment, data modeling, Semantic Query Transformation Language parsing & optimization, and effective search and retrieval mechanism.

## Security

To maintain the security and integrity of the PoK mechanism, stringent security measures are in place. Verification is enforced at multiple levels and any suspect activity triggers a detailed audit to prevent fraudulent or erroneous contributions.

## Performance Metrics

Key performance indicators such as Speed of Validation, Accuracy, Token Distribution Efficiency, and Degree of User Engagement are tracked regularly to ensure the effectiveness and fairness of the PoK mechanism.

## Conclusion

The Proof-of-Knowledge mechanism is integral to the DeSciWorld ecosystem, fostering integrity and equity throughout. The combination of blockchain and AI paves the way for a transparent validation, value attribution, and reward system. Proof-of-Knowledge effectively drives a culture of voluntary, validated, and incentivized knowledge sharing, propelling scientific research into new frontiers.
