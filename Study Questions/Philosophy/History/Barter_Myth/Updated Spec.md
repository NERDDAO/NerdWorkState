# Updated DeSciWorld Protocol Specification: Knowledge Lifecycle with kNeurons

## 1. Knowledge Creation
The lifecycle still initiates with a user ("Nerd") creating a new piece of knowledge – a Study Question (SQ). The Nerd drafts the SQ with relevant metadata and submits the SQ to the DeSciWorld blockchain ledger. An NFT symbolizing the unique identity and ownership rights of the SQ is minted.

In addition, each SQ generates a kNeuron, which represents an encapsulation of the SQ in a structured, machine-readable format. The kNeuron includes attributes like SQ ID, creator ID, metadata, validation state, and value factor.

## 2. Knowledge Validation
Validation now involves both the community and automated kNeuron validation. While community members undertake peer-review validation, the kNeuron's hashed attributes are automatically validated against data integrity rules set in the DeSciWorld protocol. 

Both these validations influence the initial attribution of value in DST tokens. Assuming the SQ passes both, the associated kNeuron is updated with a 'valid' status.

## 3. Knowledge Distribution, Usage & Appreciation
Upon validation, the SQ and its associated kNeuron become searchable. Usage metrics, tracked by an AI-driven system, influence the SQ value. Every usage triggers a royalty mechanism, producing DST tokens sent to the SQ’s owner. 

Importantly, the corresponding kNeuron also accrues value. Every time a solution, theory, or idea derived from the SQ's kNeuron is used, part of the DST tokens generated also goes to the wallet of the kNeuron's creator, incentivizing the proliferation of useful and high-quality kNeurons.

## 4. Knowledge Evolution
Over time, the value and status of a SQ and its kNeuron may change. Contributors can flag an SQ or a kNeuron as "obsolete" or "updated", invoking value adjustments.

In addition, each kNeuron has an in-built self-validation process, where it continuously validates its data against fresh inputs and updates its validation state. If an update affects the validation status, this impacts the kNeuron’s value, reflecting the dynamic nature of knowledge.

## 5. Conclusion
In this updated lifecycle, both Nerds and their created kNeurons play a key role in maintaining the DeSciWorld protocol as a dynamic knowledge reservoir. By coupling Nerd-driven knowledge with intelligent kNeurons, the DeSciWorld Protocol ensures comprehensive, continual evolution, rewarding and incentivizing contributors at every stage.
