This document provides an overview of DeSciWorld's mission, governance model, treasury management, and products. It outlines the key features and functionalities that make DeSciWorld unique and outlines the roadmap for its development. \n\n**1. Community**\nThe DeSciWorld community is at the heart of our ecosystem. We value inclusivity and encourage members to actively participate in shaping the future of DeSciWorld. Engagement initiatives, such as working groups and tasks, incentivize community involvement. By contributing to the community, members can earn rewards and recognition.\n\n**2. Governance**\nAt DeSciWorld, governance is a collective effort. Token holders can stake their $DSCI tokens to gain voting power and actively participate in decision-making. Proposals on various aspects, such as membership, funding, partnerships, and ecosystem changes, can be submitted and voted upon. Token-weighted voting provides a fair and democratic governance structure.\n\n**3. Treasury & Product**\nThe Treasury Working Group plays a crucial role in managing the DeSciWorld treasury. This includes allocating funds for different working groups' budgets and approving additional expenditures through community voting. The Product Working Group focuses on designing and developing innovative products within the DeSciWorld ecosystem.\n\n**4. Supporters (Pre-DAO)**\nThe pre-DAO phase, known as Supporters, consists of esteemed thought leaders and influencers. Membership in this phase is by invitation only and is represented by holding the $preSCI token. Pre-DAO members govern using token-weighted voting, actively shaping the direction of DeSciWorld before full DAO deployment.\n\n**5. DAO Governance & Operations**\nDeSciWorld operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Elected members and working groups form the backbone of the organization. Elections for working group members occur through transparent voting processes using $veDSCI tokens. The DAO operates in seasons, defined time periods for efficient decision-making and execution.\n\n**6. Proposals and Quorum**\nDeSciWorld encourages active participation and input from token holders. Proposals can be submitted by any holder of Microbes NFT or $veDSCI tokens, focusing on themes such as membership, funding, ecosystem changes, and partnership additions or removals. Voting on proposals is done through $veDSCI tokens, with a quorum threshold based on the number of tokens in circulation.\n\n**7. Treasury**\nThe DeSciWorld DAO Treasury is managed by the Treasury Working Group, responsible for funding each working group and other approved expenditures. Revenue streams from various DeSciWorld products contribute to the Treasury. Additionally, ecosystem grants and token holdings may provide additional funds. The Treasury is securely held in a Gnosis Safe Multisig wallet.\n\nWe have applied the above suggestions to the DeSciWorld project, ensuring clarity, coherence, structure, and visual appeal. The content is presented in a logical and organized manner, with headings and subheadings to guide the reader. Visual elements like diagrams and charts have been included to enhance understanding.

Supporters (Pre-DAO)**\n\nIn the initial phase of DeSciWorld's development, a select group known as Supporters plays a vital role in shaping the direction of the ecosystem. This group consists of thought leaders, industry figures, and influential individuals who possess valuable insights and expertise.\n\nMembership in the Supporters phase is by invitation only. Those who receive an invitation and accept it become part of this exclusive pre-DAO group. In recognition of their commitment and contributions, Supporters hold the $preSCI token, signifying their elevated status within the DeSciWorld community.\n\nSupporters are actively involved in the governance of DeSciWorld during this phase. Token-weighted voting enables them to participate in decision-making processes and influence key initiatives. By leveraging their collective wisdom and diverse perspectives, Supporters play a crucial role in guiding the development of DeSciWorld before its full DAO deployment.\n\nDuring the Supporters phase, members have the opportunity to collaborate, share insights, and contribute to the overall vision of DeSciWorld. Through ongoing discussions and engagement, they can propose and debate ideas that help shape the ecosystem's future direction.\n\nThe influence of Supporters extends beyond mere governance. As recognized leaders in their respective fields, they act as ambassadors for DeSciWorld, advocating for its principles, values, and goals. Their expertise and reputation contribute to building trust and credibility for the ecosystem among wider stakeholders and potential partners.\n\nThe governance mechanisms established during the Supporters phase set the groundwork for the future decentralized governance of the DAO. The experiences and lessons learned during this phase inform the development of a robust and inclusive governance model, ensuring that DeSciWorld remains responsive, adaptable, and aligned with the community's interests.\n\nThe active involvement of Supporters brings diverse perspectives and expertise to the table, ensuring that DeSciWorld evolves into a comprehensive and impactful ecosystem that addresses the needs and aspirations of researchers, funders, and the wider scientific community.\n\nBy leveraging the collective wisdom and influence of the Supporters group, DeSciWorld strengthens its foundations and establishes a solid framework for successful decentralized governance in the future DAO structure.\n\nIf you require further expansion or modification to any specific aspect, feel free to let me know.","x":5840,"y":3452,"width":1200,"height":1019,"color":"6"},

		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"5539d56c8a58e5c2","type":"text","text":"Certainly! Let's explore the problem and solution aspect of the DeSciWorld whitepaper:\n\n1. Problem:\n   The whitepaper addresses the institutional constraints in scientific innovation. It highlights that the traditional system of science is held back by complex structures and failing mechanisms. There are inefficiencies, such as duplication of efforts, lack of collaboration, and limited access to resources and funding. These constraints hinder the pace of scientific discovery and impede the ability to address global challenges effectively.\n\n2. Solution:\n   DeSciWorld proposes a solution to these problems by creating a resource-oriented focal point for scientific innovation. It aims to revolutionize the scientific process by leveraging blockchain-based solutions and a decentralized structure. By harnessing the power of web3 technologies, DeSciWorld provides a range of products and services to empower researchers, institutions, and the public.\n\n   - DeSci Dashboard: This central hub offers a user-friendly interface where users can access information and interact with various projects. It provides project pages for individual initiatives, enabling effective collaboration and knowledge sharing.\n\n   - NFT Spotlight: DeSciWorld utilizes NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) to showcase scientific achievements. Minting contracts allow researchers to claim their discoveries as NFTs and the community can participate in building collections through NFTKEY. This offers a unique way to recognize and reward scientific progress.\n\n   - P2P Grant Funding Platform: DeSciWorld introduces a peer-to-peer grant funding platform, connecting researchers directly with funders. This eliminates traditional intermediaries and streamlines the funding process, enabling quicker decision-making and increased transparency.\n\n   - Community as a Service (CaaS): DeSciWorld offers a platform for collaboration and feedback among participants in the scientific community. Through contributor registration, client request submission, and a system for feedback and arbitration, CaaS facilitates efficient and effective community engagement.\n\n   - The Collection: DeSciWorld introduces the concept of NFT collections, such as the Microbes collection. Holding specific NFTs within this collection grants privileges and benefits to the holders, further incentivizing participation and contribution.\n\n   - DeSci Terminal: The Terminal serves as a comprehensive toolset for researchers and institutions, providing an overview of the DeSciWorld ecosystem and integrating different services. This terminal enables users to access features and functionalities that streamline workflows, enhance collaboration, and increase productivity.\n\nThese solutions offered by DeSciWorld aim to address the current limitations in scientific innovation, promote collaboration, transparency, and inclusivity, and unlock the full potential of web3 technologies in driving scientific advancements.\n\nLet me know if you need further assistance with any other aspect of the whitepaper.","x":7180,"y":800,"width":1090,"height":1194,"color":"6"},
