# ü§ñ AI-powered DeSci

The applications for AI in science are many and varied. From classic uses such as crunching huge datasets to find patterns, to the unexpected such as writing grant proposals for researchers, scientists will likely adopt AI into their workflows as a standard. Entire divisions of research institutions will spawn to create the models required to unlock the future of science.

Science and AI are both built on the same foundations: data. Whether its weather data, survey data, experiment data, language data or image data, both have insatiable appetites to consume and produce datasets in order to improve themselves.

If AI is the carnivorous apex predator, blockchain technologies are the fertile breeding ground where data begin their life en masse. Data creation and logging is inherent to its transcational infrastructure, each and every action creating an immutable data point.

As DeSci is built on the blockchain, the amalgamation of AI and DeSci is a natural development that many are already getting ahead of the curve on. AI will allow projects to scale quicker, with less paid personnel. DeSci will produce huge and detailed datasets that will allow AI models to become more precise, reach a wider audience and have more innovative applications.

# üìà Nevermined the Adoption Curve

The accelerating pace of AI growth makes keeping up with innovation a full-time job.

Thankfully, Nevermined has created a service that allows you to monetise and easily disseminate your data and AI models through their **Smart Subscriptions** NFT system. Simply link your web service based AI agent, set the payment conditions and they .generate an NFT that your users can subscribe to and use to access your AI or data right away. All in just a few simple clicks!

Now AI agents have a means to monetize and to transact with external services without the need for a PoS or credit card. In other words, they‚Äôve given agents (and associated services) a payment gateway and tokengating superpowers.

## What does this mean?

**As a user**, you can access and utilise powerful AI agents and associated datasets with web3 wallet payments.

**As an engineer**, you can monetise your AI models with subscription plans for different access times, prices and custom terms and conditions.

Accessing and adopting AI in Web3 just got a whole lot easier and more decentralised.

# üå≥ Yggdrasil Chatbot

![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:800/1*WHcEfrGNwL0BMryPDNPSFA.jpeg)

Yggdrasil ‚Äî the sacred Norse ‚Äútree of life‚Äù

> **Yggdrasil** (from Old Norse **Yggdrasill**) is an immense and central sacred tree in Norse cosmology. Around it exists all else, including the Nine Worlds. ‚Äî [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yggdrasil])

**The Yggdrasil is designed to become the single most powerful general-purpose DeSci FAQ chatbot.** Host it on the Discord server or website of your DAO, ask it a question and it will return you an answer from its growing corpus of DeSci knowledge.

DeSciWorld, in its mission to onboard scientists into DeSci, has developed this powerful AI chatbot designed to handle any and all questions regarding Decentralised Science. The Yggdrasil bot is an AI agent available for access through the Nevermined platform, to be utilised by anyone in DeSci; be it organisations, people or other AI bots.

## Terms of Use

There are two key terms of use:

1. Yggdrasil is available to anyone FOR FREE for the next three months, in an initial ‚Äú**Bootstrap**‚Äù subscription phase.
2. Subscribers to Yggdrasil‚Äôs Bootstrap phase must contribute towards the underlying corpus of data by submitting **relevant DeSci datasets** for DeSciWorld to add to the AI‚Äôs collateral. This can include whitepapers, research papers, medium articles, website frontends for scraping, Twitter threads etc.

This Bootstrap phase will end in three months and we will reasses the pricing structure for new access to the bot. After this bootstrap phase, we will also change the access structure for the underlying collateral to the bot to become more open-source.

**_Those that contribute to the corpus during this bootstrapping phase will receive preferential discount towards future usage of Yggdrasil._**

# üìù Summariser Bot

The second bot in the roster is the **DeSciWorld Research Publication Summariser Bot**.

We see incredible commercial potential in an AI agent that can take research publications of 10‚Äì30 pages in length and condense them into a **1 page summary**, complete with abstract, methodology, list of present molecules and proteins, citations, references and authors.

The bot we are developing with Nevermined has a relatively narrow scope at present, perfect for medicine and chemical biology publications, but we are working on a system to provide a Summariser bot capable of handling input from **ANY** field of science; to produce almost instantly a digestible 1 pager that gives key information and data points.

As the Summariser Bot is a more complex and nuanced service, we are choosing a **paid subscription** plan for this agent. This will be a relatively low cost to access, and the produced summaries will also be available for purchase. Our ambition is to create a cheap and efficient marketplace of summarised papers that researchers around the world can utilise.

# ‚ùóÔ∏è Get Access

We are rolling access to both Yggdrasil and the Summariser Bot over the coming weeks, with tutorials and community events to help with onboarding.
