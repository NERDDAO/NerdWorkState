# Reflections

In an industry that never rests, it is important to occasionally stop and reflect on our mission statements. How relevant are they? Are we actually moving towards achieving them?

At DeSciWorld, our mission statement has been clear:

> **Unite and empower the decentralised research community by supporting innovators worldwide. To give science back to the people: unbiased; uncensorable and impervious to the capture we experience today.**

However, as the DeSci movement grows in both size and stature, it is clear that as a space we are concentrating the centre of our power toward the pre-existing hegemons: Western Europe and North America. Whilst great headway has been made around the world, especially in Latin America, the majority of conferences, capital flows and project teams are all flowing to the predominant authorities of the last century.

Understandable? Absolutely! Acceptable? Not really.

Exclusionary and regressive patterns have crept into the fabric of DeSci and we must reassess and begin to build those foundations from which we can build our **new, globally empowered home;** we must avoid the mistakes of the past.

# Introducing “World of DeSci”

It is because of these reflections that DeSciWorld has decided to launch its own DeSci conference circuit — **“World of DeSci”**.

This bi-annual conference is designed to bring DeSci to those emerging markets whose researchers have received less domestic resources, to the nations experiencing brain drain, to the people that are currently left on the outside of this wave of progress.

The core objective of **World of DeSci** is to integrate DeSci tooling into the workflow of local scientists in developing nations. By demonstrating the revolutionary potential of Web3 technologies for researchers, we hope to assist in the incubation of global DeSci communities that can compete with any other.

This is how we bring DeSciWorld closer to achieving its mission statement.

Below you see our “**Trifecta of Effective Integration**”, the framework that underpins this initiative:

# The Trifecta of Effective Integration

In a bid to achieve the truly distributed scientific community that Decentralised Science dreams of, we must bring the tools to the people who need them.

## Students

Students are the lifeblood of science. Young, passionate and often wonderfully optimistic, we believe that the most powerful and revolutionary ideas will come from this group. On the one hand students tend to have less vested interest in continuing the encumbency of the status quo — the system has caused many issues in the world that they must now tackle. On the other hand, students have less to lose and are more willing to take calculated risks. DeSci is primed for their adoption.

## Academia

Academic societies dictate the direction of the populations as their research and recommendations influence policy at all levels. Think tanks are the sages of old. It is essential that the DeSci community demonstrates to these powerful substrates that decentralisation and the redistributive potential that comes with it is the best method to cure the ills that we face today. In order to influence policy, we must enlighten policymakers.

## Industry

Finally, the theoretical underpinning of students and academia wont achieve much without the practical applications of industry. The trend of the last century is for competent scientists to go where they receive the best compensation — Western scientific industry. Indian doctors go to Europe, African pharmacists go to Big Pharma, South American chemists do their research in the US. This has invariably left local research communities lacking in both talent and funding. A deadly cycle that can only be broken by brave individuals creating value in their own lands. DeSci can be a core toolset to empower local industry, who in turn can compete with the global scientific industry.

# Showcase

After gathering together the trifecta, we then gather the encumbents of DeSci. This becomes a unique opportunity for builders in the space to present their work to a brand new set of eyes.

Recruitment, partnership and potentially investments from globally distributed players will entice DeScientists to join our conference and contribute to the effort of bringing DeSci to the rest of the world. The diversity of participants leads to diversity of ideas; the traditional, rational materialist points of view may find a wealth of unexpected innovation as we integrate with cultures from around the world.

Most scientists are yet completely unaware of DeSci and the direction that it is building: decentralised research funding and peer review; new incentive mechanisms that reward the scientist not the publisher; radically open data storage and provenance trails that solve the reproducibility crisis — to name a few.

With the recent [walkouts at Elsevier](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2023/may/07/too-greedy-mass-walkout-at-global-science-journal-over-unethical-fees), it is clear that the global research community is ready for change. We must present the vehicle of change to them.

# Incubation

Demonstrating DeSci to the local research community is not the end of our contribution. Once the interest is piqued, we help to form a defined community in the area we visit. This will most likely take the form of a DAO.

It is essential that DeSci enthusiasts have a place to meet, ideate and create within their own country. The successes of [DeSci Berlin](https://twitter.com/DeSciBerlin?s=20), [DeSci London](https://twitter.com/DesciLondon?s=20), [DeSci NYC](https://twitter.com/DeSciNYC/status/1648737837192290304), [DeSci Japan](https://twitter.com/DeSciJapan?s=20) and the many other geographically-based DeSci communities show the importance of a local meeting point. In an almost exclusively online industry, we sometimes forget the importance of those water-cooler moments, the collaborative power of working together on a whiteboard, the holistic benefit of eye contact and a handshake.

DeSciWorld, together with its experience and connections in the DAO space, provide a foundation for the local DeSci community to build upon through network share, initial DAO setup assistance, signal boosting and even potentially startup funding.

# World of DeSci: Belgrade

To kick off the new conference circuit, we are hosting our pilot event in Belgrade, Serbia. Courtesy of Web3House, we will host the event at the old [MegaTrend University](https://g.co/kgs/HhnhAB) campus.

As a proof-of-concept event, World of DeSci: Belgrade brings together some of the brightest minds and biggest projects building across the DeSci, OpSci and DAO infrastructure space and presents them to the Serbian research community. We have connected directly with local universities and student unions to bring the event to as many of the budding youth of Belgrade as possible.

Together with a team of local representatives on the ground in Belgrade, led by the formidable [Filip Milenkovic](https://www.linkedin.com/in/philipmilenkovic/), we anticipate this event to be the most unique and interesting DeSci event of the year so far.

Presentations, panels and workshops that are suitable for all abilities and Web3 experience levels, we hope to provide a foundation from which the individual researchers can springboard to their journey into DeSci.

As we collaborate in the lead-up to the event, we will continue that partnership afterwards through the creation and incubation of the **DeSci Belgrade** community — the Web3House initiative has already allocated a monthly slot for them to utilise.

More than just showcasing DeSci, we are actively collaborating with the local communities to expand our own understanding of DeSci: what are we missing; what needs have we neglected thus far; are we pandering to Western sensibilities and ignoring the ideas of other schools of thoughts?

# Final Notes

Connecting the disconnected is a lofty goal that DeSci as a whole has taken upon itself. At DeSciWorld, we have made this mission core to our entire being. Leveraging our position as the superconnector makes this task easier, as we have spent the entirety of our lifecycle making friendships and partnerships with every project building in this space. Mutual support of all has been our modus operandi since inception.

Building online tooling and working with communities from around the world through social media and online events is a wonderful service that we do better than anyone. This boots-on-the-ground initiative is the next step on the road to global exposure of the power of DeSci and, we feel, the essential ingredient to empowering research communities around the world.

The World of DeSci circuit is a wonderful way to further the concepts of open science and decentralisation in societies that receive less than their fair share of resources and attention.

For those that made it this far, its also worth mentioning that we are integrating the [Microbes NFT](https://desci.world/nft/desciworldmicrobes) into this ecosystem; special access, gifts and standalone events await!
