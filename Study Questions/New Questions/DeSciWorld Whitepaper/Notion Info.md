> A communication and product framework is a structured approach or set of guidelines that helps teams effectively communicate and collaborate on product development. It defines the processes, tools, and principles that guide how information is shared. This space will serve as a central post for a DeSciWorld communication and product framework that will facilitate seamless communication and efficient product marketing.

V1 with feedback on

- _DeScientist_ _Terminal: A platform that lets curious researchers engage with the global DeSci community_

I like the description, i think "DeSci Terminal" or similar works better

- _DeResearch Launchpad: Enabling permissionless deployment and funding of research_

This isnt correct. The launchpad is only for NFTs, and its permissioned, like OpenSea Drops basically. It's also not specifically for research funding, as the NFt sale funds can be used for anything really

- Public Funding Marketplace: Tooling that simplifies scientists seeking research funding

Yep great description. I guess it should also include mention that as a potential funder, you can also offer a bounty for researchers to come along and complete.¬† The name is nice, although i think Jelani doesnt like the idea of being called a marketplace, i;m beginning to agree with him
