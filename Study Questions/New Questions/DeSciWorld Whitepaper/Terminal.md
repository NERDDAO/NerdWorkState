### Purpose

The DeSci Terminal, or "Terminal" for short, is an information aggregation platform designed to improve participation and engagement in DeSci by providing a range of simple to use tools for staying up to date with all that is happening in the space. 

A resource oriented focal point for the open science community to understand what projects are building in the space, how to get involved in those projects and what other initiatives are being created by DeScientists.

### Features
##### Dashboard
The Dashboard features a comprehensive list of the projects currently operating in DeSci. The dashboard is populated by DeSci projects, who have submitted their information through our sign up forms.

Each dashboard entry has its own page. Within each page, users can view a detailed summary of the project's purpose, it's team, its mission and values, any research publications they may have released, events that they are hosting, NFTs that they have minted or are hoping to sell, links to their community and social media and more! This information is pulled from the other aspects of the Terminal.

The dashboard will grow to have a premium analytics service in which we conduct detailed in house analysis of the respective projects, to provide deep insights into the platform that might not be available elsewhere.

We will periodically host a "Featured Project" as a service to DeSci projects that want to boost their name within the DeSciWorld community.

##### Events Calendar
An aggregated calendar that lists events happening within the DeSci ecosystem. This includes real world events and conferences, along with online events such as interviews, podcasts, live streams and Twitter Spaces.

This calendar can also be synced to other popular calendar apps.

##### Job Board
The DeSciWorld Job Board aggregates the open position working opportunities with the DeSci ecosystem. Users can view and apply for the jobs by navigating through the Terminal.

##### Interactive World Map
The Interactive World Map is powered by ARCGIS and offers a comprehensive and deeply interactive method for users to view the DeSci landscape but from a global map point of view. This includes learning where projects are based, where events will be held, statistics about the distribution of demographics to assist in understanding the diversity of the DeSci landscape and more.

##### Forum
The Forum is an online message board that utilises the Mosaic platform to allow users to post question on the desci.world website and subsequently stream those questions to DeSci projects that have subscribed to particular tags. For example, a bioDAO Discord could subscribe to the "longevity" tag and receive any related questions direct to their server, answer those questions and gather reputation points for doing so.

The core concept here is to have a living discussion around all things DeSci, to shine a light on some topics that are rarely discussed and often taboo.
