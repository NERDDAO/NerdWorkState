What is DeSci?

DeSci stands for “Decentralised Science” and is a play on the term “DeFi”, the Decentralised Finance wave that has been sweeping the world for the last 18 months. DeSci is the concept of solving the problems experienced within the traditional scientific research communities with decentralised, blockchain-based solutions.

What is DeSciWorld?

DeSciWorld aims to become the beating heart of the DeSci space. Funded and directed by the DeSciWorldDAO, DeSciWorld exists as a vehicle to promote and expand the culture of Decentralised Science. DeSciWorld's role of connecting decentralised and research communities will bring much-needed innovation to these somewhat sclerotic processes. Community engagement, participation incentivisation and accessible infrastructure will be a boon for excitement in science not seen since the Space Race era.
