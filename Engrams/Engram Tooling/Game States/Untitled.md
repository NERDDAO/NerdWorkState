Suicide among teens is a complex issue and it may develop due to multiple factors. Here is an overview of the potential determinants based on reputable research and studies:

1. Mental Health Disorders: One of the biggest risk factors for teen suicide is the presence of mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia. 

2. Substance Abuse: Substance abuse can increase the risk of suicide. This includes the abuse of drugs, alcohol, and certain medications. Substance abuse can exacerbate mental health problems and lower inhibitions, making suicide attempts more likely.

3. Family History: A family history of suicide or suicidal behaviors can increase the risk.

4. Exposure to Violence: Exposure to violence, either at home or within their community, can put teenagers at a higher risk of suicide. 

5. Social Isolation or Bullying: Teens who experience bullying, which can lead to feelings of rejection, humiliation or shame, or have few friends may be at higher risk. 

6. Stressful Life Events: These could include things like divorce, death of a loved one, trauma, or significant life changes that the teen has difficulty coping with.

7. Access to Lethal Means: Having easier access to things like firearms, drugs, and other lethal means can increase the risk of suicide.

8. Barriers to Accessing Mental Health Treatment: Barriers could include lack of availability, perceived stigma associated with seeking help, and cost.

Research:

- "Suicide and Suicide Attempts in Adolescents" by the American Academy of Pediatrics. This reference is from a clinical report detailing the risk factors and preventive interventions for adolescent suicide. 

- "Understanding Suicide among Teens" by the National Institute of Mental Health. This article published by a U.S. government institute of health discusses the risk factors, warning signs, and prevention strategies related to teen suicide.

Remember that the above details are just potential determinants; not every teen going through these situations will be at risk. It's essential always to talk openly about mental health and seek professional help when there are signs of it worsening.
