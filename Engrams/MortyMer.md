Roy A Life Well Lived Rick and Morty Adult Swim

Players assume the role of [Roy](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Roy "Roy"), and the goal of the game is to guide Roy through life, from childhood to death, overcoming obstacles along the way. The game's programming will adjust Roy's life path and the events that happen to him according to the decisions the user makes. The premise seems similar to The Matrix, with elements of a _Choose Your Own Adventure_ story mashed with a RPG.

The game engine appears to support a single player character and approximately five billion (human) NPCs simulated at a 1 : 1 (second to month) speed ratio (according to Rick before [Summer](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Summer_Smith "Summer Smith")'s attempted Die-Hard) for the duration of the Roy's in-game life. It is also stated that the simulation allows any in-game players to travel past the edge of the universe, but will boot the user from their helmet interface allowing them to wake up in real life as a failsafe.

There is no formal point system in the game as the final score for the player is how many years Roy lived. To the unprepared players though, the transition can be disorientating, as the memories players gain from the game will conflict with the ones from real life and vice versa.

There was a sequel made to the game called _[Roy 2: Dave](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Roy_2:_Dave "Roy 2: Dave")_, as well as a bootleg version called _[Troy: A Life Lived](https://rickandmorty.fandom.com/wiki/Troy:_A_Life_Lived "Troy: A Life Lived")_.

There was another sequel, called _Roy 3: Woman Talking About Video Games on the Internet_. It was mentioned to be survival horror.
