Roy is a game about human choices in life. This game starts you at 1 years old and gives you 1 choice per decade on how you want to live that time by interpreting the New Year's Resolution Roy takes that decade, given the context of what age you are, life choices up until that point, finances, experiences, and everything that a normal human can do. 

The goal is that Roy is a born same as anyone else, and that you can make a infinite number of decisions that lead to an infinite number of outcomes, but you are still limited by one human lifespan. So the discovery is how you will spend that lifespan many different times. 

Each New Years Day, you will say what you'd like to accomplish and then simulate how that will act that out for you with all of the context of life applied to it, including mortality rates, incarceration rates, marriage success, children or no, financial earnings, bankruptcy--truly everything that applies to your current life. In the end, each players Roy will die, but the life you lived will be unique. At the end of your playthrough, you will be able to mind an NFT containing a visualization of your Roy, and that Roy's abridged story. 

The AI game state will act and apply real life events, actuarial statistics, age-related illnesses, financial boons, ownership of land, etcetera. The goal is to allow users to set change the course of Roy's Life once per decade and take in a wide state of desires and intentions and then see what that life would produce when the life event statistics are rolled.  

Roy will have some constants. The first birthday will be December 31st, 1999, so each user will have the same starting line. And like all life, there will be a death date, which will be variable dependent on the ai game state applied statistics and choices the users make each year. The year-by-year story telling should cover the emotional, physical, financial, and if applicable spiritual developments. These should point out notable moments in illustrious detail. 

The scope of options is infinite, but limited by age, finances, physical ability and any other applicable and realistic limitations.
