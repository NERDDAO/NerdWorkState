A practical example could be the implementation of a supply chain management system. \n\nLet's create an ontology to represent entities within a supply chain:\n\n### Ontology for Supply Chain Management System\n\n```typescript\n// Entities:\n\ntype Product {\n    productId: string;\n    name: string;\n    description: string;\n    specifications: Specification[];\n}\n\ntype Specification {\n    attribute: string;\n    value: string;\n}\n\ntype Order {\n    orderId: string;\n    customer: Customer;\n    orderDetails: OrderDetail[];\n    status: OrderStatus;\n}\n\ntype OrderDetail {\n    product: Product;\n    quantity: number;\n    unitPrice: number;\n}\n\ntype Customer {\n    customerId: string;\n    name: string;\n    contactDetails: ContactDetail;\n}\n\ntype ContactDetail {\n    phone: string;\n    email: string;\n    address: string;\n}\n\ntype Inventory {\n    product: Product;\n    quantityAvailable: number;\n}\n\nenum OrderStatus {\n    Received,\n    Processing,\n    Shipped,\n    Delivered,\n    Cancelled\n}\n```\n\n### Real-World Test Case\n\nThe real-world test case for this ontology would ensure that when an order is placed, the inventory is updated, and the order status reflects reality throughout its lifecycle.\n\n```typescript\ndescribe('Supply Chain Order Processing', () => {\n    test('Placing an order updates the inventory and order status correctly', () => {\n        // Arrange: Initialize the inventory with some products\n        const initialInventoryQuantity = 100;\n        const inventory = new Inventory(new Product('123', 'Widget'), initialInventoryQuantity);\n        const customer = new Customer('cust-001', 'Acme Corporation');\n\n        // Act: Place an order for a quantity of the product\n        const orderQuantity = 10;\n        const order = new Order('order-001', customer, [{\n            product: inventory.product,\n            quantity: orderQuantity,\n            unitPrice: 9.99\n        }]);\n        \n        // Process the order, normally this would be more complex, involving multiple steps\n        inventory.updateQuantity(-orderQuantity);\n        order.updateStatus(OrderStatus.Processing);\n\n        // Assert: Check that the inventory quantity has been reduced by the order amount\n        expect(inventory.quantityAvailable).toBe(initialInventoryQuantity - orderQuantity);\n        \n        // Assert: Verify that the order status is set to 'Processing'\n        expect(order.status).toBe(OrderStatus.Processing);\n\n        // Advance the order status through to completion\n        order.updateStatus(OrderStatus.Shipped);\n        order.updateStatus(OrderStatus.Delivered);\n\n        // Assert: Confirm that the final order status is 'Delivered'\n        expect(order.status).toBe(OrderStatus.Delivered);\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIn this real-world test case:\n\n1. **Reusability**: The same test logic can be applied regardless of which specific product is being ordered.\n2. **Flexibility**: The test case works for different customers and order details, adapting to the particular circumstances of each order.\n3. **Extensibility**: The test can be enhanced to track additional stages, such as payment processing or handling returns.\n4. **Adaptability**: Should the ontology expand to include new entities like suppliers or shipping providers, the core functionality of order processing remains the subject of the test.\n\nThis test case structure ensures that the principles of order processing—inventory updates and status tracking—are consistently respected, which is crucial to the integrity of a supply chain management system. By applying these generalizable principles, we can prove the system's capability to handle various supply chain scenarios while maintaining coherence and reliability, much like we would for a complex game state in video games.","x":-460,"y":9229,"width":885,"height":1554,"color":"6"},

		{"id":"6e3250388c0b7bdd","type":"text","text":" 4 **Weaker Notions of Belief** In Section 3, we motivated the axioms of our system SELK,2,B in part by the fact that they allowed us to achieve a reduction of belief to knowledge-and-knowability in the spirit of Stalnaker’s result. SELK,2,B includes several of Stalnaker original axioms (or modiﬁcations thereof), but also two new schemes: weak factivity (wF) and conﬁdent belief (CB). As noted, if we forget the distinction between knowledge and knowability, each of these schemes holds in Stal (Proposition 2). Nonetheless, in our tri-modal logic these two principles do not follow from the others: one can adopt (our translations of) Stalnaker’s original principles while rejecting one or both of (wF) and (CB). In particular, this allows one to essentially accept all of Stalnaker’s premises without being forced to the conclusion that belief is reducible to knowledge (or even knowledge-and-knowability). We are therefore motivated to generalize our earlier semantics in order to study weaker logics in which the belief modality is not deﬁnable and so requires its own semantic machinery. A. Bjorndahl & A. ¨Ozg¨un 97 In this section we do just this: we augment ELK,2 with the axiom schemes given in Table 4 to form the logic ELK,2,B, and prove that this system is sound and complete with respect to the new semantics deﬁned below. We then consider logics intermediate in strength between ELK,2,B and SELK,2,B—speciﬁcally, those obtained by augmenting ELK,2,B with the axioms (DB) (consistency of belief), (wF), or (CB)—and establish soundness and completeness results for these logics as well. As before, we rely on topological (KB) ⊢ B(ϕ → ψ) → (Bϕ → Bψ) Distribution of belief (sPI) ⊢ Bϕ → KBϕ Strong positive introspection (KB) ⊢ Kϕ → Bϕ Knowledge implies belief (RB) ⊢ Bϕ → B2ϕ Responsible belief Table 4: Additional axiom schemes for ELK,2,B subset models X = (X, T, v) for the requisite semantic structure (see Section 2.2); however, we deﬁne the evaluation of formulas with respect to epistemic-doxastic (e-d) scenarios, which are tuples of the form (x,U,V ) where (x,U) is an epistemic scenario, V ∈ T, and V ⊆ U. We call V the doxastic range.6 The semantic evaluation for the primitive propositions and the Boolean connectives is deﬁned as usual; for the modal operators, we make use of the following semantic clauses: (X, x,U,V ) |= Kϕ iff U = [[ϕ]]U,V (X, x,U,V ) |= 2ϕ iff x ∈ int([[ϕ]]U,V ) (X, x,U,V ) |= Bϕ iff V ⊆ [[ϕ]]U,V , where [[ϕ]]U,V = {x ∈ U : (X, x,U,V ) |= ϕ}. Thus, the modalities K and 2 are interpreted essentially as they were before, while the modality B is rendered as universal quantiﬁcation over the doxastic range. Intuitively, we might think of V as the agent’s “conjecture” about the way the world is, typically stronger than what is guaranteed by her evidence-in-hand U. On this view, states in V might be conceptualized as “more plausible” than states in U V from the agent’s perspective, with belief being interpreted as truth in all these more plausible states (see, e.g., [21, 10, 7, 11, 18] for more details on plausibility models for belief). Note that we do not require that x ∈ V ; this corresponds to the intuition that the agent may have false beliefs. Note also that none of the modalities alter either the epistemic or the doxastic range; this is essentially what guarantees the validity of the strong introspection axioms.7 In order to distinguish these semantics from those previous, we refer to them as epistemic-doxastic (e-d) semantics for topological subset spaces. Theorem 8. ELK,2,B is a sound and complete axiomatization of LK,2,B with respect to the class of all topological subset spaces under e-d semantics. Call an e-d scenario (x,U,V ) consistent if V ̸= /0, and call it dense if V is dense in U (i.e., if U ⊆ cl(V )). 6If we want to insist on consistent beliefs, we should add the axiom (DB): Bϕ → ˆBϕ (or, equivalently, ˆB⊤) and require that V ̸= /0. We begin with the more general case, without these assumptions. 7We could, of course, consider even more general semantics that do not validate these axioms, but as our goal here is to understand the role of weak factivity and conﬁdent belief in the context of Stalnaker’s reduction of belief to knowledge, we leave such investigations to future work. 98 Logic and Topology for Knowledge, Knowability, and Belief Theorem 9. ELK,2,B + (DB) is a sound and complete axiomatization of LK,2,B with respect to the class of all topological subset spaces under e-d semantics for consistent e-d scenarios. ELK,2,B + (wF) is a sound and complete axiomatization of LK,2,B with respect to the class of all topological subset spaces under e-d semantics for dense e-d scenarios. 4.1 Conﬁdent belief It turns out that the strong semantics for the belief modality presented in Section 3, namely (X, x,U) |= Bϕ iff U ⊆ cl(int([[ϕ]]U )), does not arise as a special case of our new e-d semantics: there is no condition (e.g., density) one can put on the doxastic range V so that these two interpretations of Bϕ agree in general. Roughly speaking, this is because the formulas of the form 2ϕ ∨ 2¬2ϕ correspond to the open and dense sets, but in general one cannot ﬁnd a (nonempty) open set V that is simultaneously contained in every open, dense set. As such, one cannot hope to validate (CB) in the e-d semantics presented above without also validating B⊥. However, we can validate (CB) on topological subset spaces by altering the semantic interpretation of the belief modality so that, intuitively, it “ignores” nowhere dense sets.8 Loosely speaking, this works because nowhere dense sets are exactly the complements of sets with dense interiors. More precisely, we work with the same notion of e-d scenarios as before, but use the following semantics clauses: (X, x,U,V ) |≈ p iff x ∈ v(p) (X, x,U,V ) |≈ ¬ϕ iff (X, x,U,V ) |̸≈ ϕ (X, x,U,V ) |≈ ϕ ∧ ψ iff (X, x,U,V ) |≈ ϕ and (X, x,U,V ) |≈ ψ (X, x,U,V ) |≈ Kϕ iff U = [(ϕ)]U,V (X, x,U,V ) |≈ 2ϕ iff x ∈ int([(ϕ)]U,V ) (X, x,U,V ) |≈ Bϕ iff V ⊆∗ [(ϕ)]U,V , where [(ϕ)]U,V = {x ∈ U : (X, x,U,V ) |≈ ϕ}, and we write A ⊆∗ B iff A B is nowhere dense. In other words, we interpret everything as before with the exception of the belief modality, which now effectively quantiﬁes over almost all worlds in the doxastic range V rather than over all worlds.9 Theorem 10. ELK,2,B + (CB) is a sound and complete axiomatization of LK,2,B with respect to the class of all topological subset spaces under e-d semantics using the semantics given above: for all formulas ϕ ∈ LK,2,B, if |≈ ϕ, then ⊢ELK,2,B+(CB) ϕ. Moreover, SELK,2,B is sound and complete with respect to these semantics for e-d scenarios where V = U. ","x":55,"y":2824,"width":479,"height":189},
		{"id":"aac36d2ac5b88315","type":"text","text":" 2.2 **Topological subset models** \n \n A subset space is a pair (X, S) where X is a nonempty set of worlds and S ⊆ 2X is a collection of subsets of X. A subset model X = (X, S, v) is a subset space (X, S) together with a function v : PROP → 2X specifying, for each primitive proposition p ∈ PROP, its extension v(p). Subset space semantics interpret formulas not at worlds x but at epistemic scenarios of the form (x,U), where x ∈ U ∈ S. Let ES(X) denote the collection of all such pairs in X. Given an epistemic scenario (x,U) ∈ ES(X), the set U is called its epistemic range; intuitively, it represents the agent’s current information as determined, for example, by the measurements she has taken. We interpret LK in X as follows: (X, x,U) |= p iff x ∈ v(p) (X, x,U) |= ¬ϕ iff (X, x,U) ̸|= ϕ (X, x,U) |= ϕ ∧ ψ iff (X, x,U) |= ϕ and (X, x,U) |= ψ (X, x,U) |= Kϕ iff (∀y ∈ U)((X, y,U) |= ϕ). Thus, knowledge is cashed out as truth in all epistemically possible worlds, analogously to the standard semantics for knowledge in relational models. A formula ϕ is said to be satisﬁable in X if there is some (x,U) ∈ ES(X) such that (X, x,U) |= ϕ, and valid in X if for all (x,U) ∈ ES(X) we have (X, x,U) |= ϕ. The set [[ϕ]] U X = {x ∈ U : (X, x,U) |= ϕ} is called the extension of ϕ under U. We sometimes drop mention of the subset model X when it is clear from context. Subset space models are well-equipped to give an account of evidence-based knowledge and its dynamics. Elements of S can be thought of as potential pieces of evidence, while the epistemic range U of an epistemic scenario (x,U) corresponds to the “evidence-in-hand” by means of which the agent’s knowledge is evaluated. This is made precise in the semantic clause for Kϕ, which stipulates that the agent knows ϕ just in case ϕ is entailed by the evidence-in-hand. In this framework, stronger evidence corresponds to a smaller epistemic range, and whether a given proposition can come to be known corresponds (roughly speaking) to whether there exists a sufﬁciently strong piece of (true) evidence that entails it. This notion is naturally and succinctly formalized topolog- ically. A topological space is a pair (X, T) where X is a nonempty set and T ⊆ 2X is a collection of subsets of X that covers X and is closed under ﬁnite intersections and arbitrary unions. The collection T is called a topology on X and elements of T are called open sets. In what follows we assume familiarity with basic topological notions; for a general introduction to topology we refer the reader to [19, 20]. A topological subset model is a subset model X = (X, T, v) in which T is a topology on X. Clearly every topological space is a subset space. But topological spaces possess additional structure that enables A. Bjorndahl & A. ¨Ozg¨un 93 us to study the kinds of epistemic dynamics we are interested in. More precisely, we can capture a notion of knowability via the following deﬁnition: for A ⊆ X, say that x lies in the interior of A if there is some U ∈ T such that x ∈ U ⊆ A. The set of all points in the interior of A is denoted int(A); it is easy to see that int(A) is the largest open set contained in A. Given an epistemic scenario (x,U) and a primitive proposition p, we have x ∈ int([[p]]U ) precisely when there is some evidence V ∈ T that is true at x and that entails p. We therefore interpret the extended language LK,2 that includes the “knowable” modality in X via the additional recursive clause (X, x,U) |= 2ϕ iff x ∈ int([[ϕ]]U ). The formula 2ϕ thus represents knowability as a restricted existential claim over the set T of available pieces of evidence. The dual modality correspondingly satisﬁes (X, x,U) |= 3ϕ iff x ∈ cl([[ϕ]]U ), where cl denotes the topological closure operator.3 Since the formula 2¬ϕ reads as “the agent could come to know that ϕ is false”, one intuitive reading of its negation, 3ϕ, is “ϕ is unfalsiﬁable”. It is worth noting that the intuition behind reading 2ϕ as “ϕ is knowable” can falter when ϕ is itself an epistemic formula. In particular, if ϕ is the Moore sentence p ∧ ¬K p, then Kϕ is not satisﬁable in any subset model, so in this sense ϕ can never be known; nonetheless, 2ϕ is satisﬁable. Loosely speaking, this is because our language abstracts away from the implicit temporal dimension of knowability; 2ϕ might be more accurately glossed as “one could come to know what ϕ used to express (before you came to know it)”.4 Since primitive propositions do not change their truth value based on the agent’s epistemic state, this subtlety is irrelevant for propositional knowledge and knowability. For the purposes of this paper, we opt for the simpliﬁed “knowability” gloss of the 2 modality, and leave further investigation of this subtlety to future work.

Stalnaker proves that this system (DB) ⊢ Bϕ → ¬B¬ϕ Consistency of belief (sPI) ⊢ Bϕ → KBϕ Strong positive introspection (sNI) ⊢ ¬Bϕ → K¬Bϕ Strong negative introspection (KB) ⊢ Kϕ → Bϕ Knowledge implies belief (FB) ⊢ Bϕ → BKϕ Full belief Table 2: Stalnaker’s additional axiom schemes yields the pure belief logic KD45B; moreover, he shows that Stal proves the following equivalence: A. Bjorndahl & A. ¨Ozg¨un 91 Bϕ ↔ ˆKKϕ. Thus, belief in this system is reducible to knowledge; every formula of LK,B can be trans- lated into a provably equivalent formula in LK. Stalnaker also shows that although only the S4K system is assumed for knowledge, Stal actually derives the stronger system S4.2K. What justiﬁes the assumption of these particular properties of knowledge and belief? It is, of course, possible to object to any of them (including the features of knowledge picked out by the system S4K); however, in this paper we focus on the relationships expressed in (KB) and (FB). That knowing implies believing is widely taken for granted—loosely speaking, it corresponds to a conception of knowledge as a special kind of belief. Full belief,1 on the other hand, may seem more contentious; this is because it is keyed to a rather strong notion of belief. The English verb “to believe” has a variety of uses that vary quite a bit in the nature of the attitude ascribed to the subject. For example, the sentence, “I believe Mary is in her ofﬁce, but I’m not sure” makes a clearly possibilistic claim, whereas, “I believe that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light” might naturally be interpreted as expressing a kind of certainty. It is this latter sense of belief that Stalnaker seeks to capture: belief as subjective certainty. On this reading, (FB) essentially stipulates that being certain is not subjectively distinguishable from knowing: an agent who feels certain that ϕ is true also feels certain that she knows that ϕ is true. At a high level, then, each of (KB) and (FB) have a certain plausibility. Crucially, however, we contend that their joint plausibility is predicated on an abstract conception of knowledge that permits a kind of equivocation. In particular, tension between the two emerges when knowledge is interpreted more concretely in terms of what is justiﬁed by a body of evidence. Consider the following informal account of knowledge: an agent knows something just in case it is entailed by the available evidence. To be sure, this is still vague since we have not yet speciﬁed what “evidence” is or what “available” means (we return to formalize these notions in Section 2.2). But it is motivated by a very commonsense interpretation of knowledge, as for example in a card game when one player is said to know their opponent is not holding two aces on the basis of the fact that they are themselves holding three aces. Even at this informal level, one can see that something like this conception of knowledge lies at the root of the standard possible worlds semantics for epistemic logic. Roughly speaking, such semantics work as follows: each world w is associated with a set of accessible worlds R(w), and the agent is said to know ϕ at w just in case ϕ is true at all worlds in R(w). A standard intuition for this interpretation of knowledge is given in terms of evidence: the worlds in R(w) are exactly those compatible with the agent’s evidence at w, and so the agent knows ϕ just in case the evidence rules out all not-ϕ possibilities. Suppose, for instance, that you have measured your height and obtained a reading of 5 feet and 10 inches ±1 inch. With this measurement in hand, you can be said to know that you are less than 6 feet tall, having ruled out the possibility that you are taller. Call this the evidence-in-hand conception of knowledge. Observe that it ﬁts well with the (KB) principle: evidence-in-hand that entails ϕ should surely also cause you to believe ϕ. On the other hand, it does not sit comfortably with (FB): presumably you can be (subjectively) certain of ϕ without simultaneously being certain that you currently have evidence-in-hand that guarantees ϕ, lest we lose the distinction between belief and knowledge.2 However, the intuition for (FB) can be recovered by shifting the meaning of “available evidence” to a weaker existential claim: that there is evidence entailing ϕ— even if you don’t happen to personally have it in hand at the moment. This corresponds to a transition from the known to the knowable. On this account, (FB) is recast as “If you are certain of ϕ, then you are 1Stalnaker calls this property “strong belief” but we, following [2, 3], adopt the term “full belief” instead. 2This assumes, roughly speaking, that evidence-in-hand is “transparent” in the sense that the agent cannot be mistaken about what evidence she has or what it entails. A model rich enough to represent this kind of uncertainty about evidence might therefore be of interest; we leave the development of such a model to other work. 92 Logic and Topology for Knowledge, Knowability, and Belief certain that there is evidence entailing ϕ”, a sort of dictum of responsible belief: do not believe anything unless you think you could come to know it. Returning to (KB), on the other hand, we see that it is not supported by this weaker sense of evidence-availability: the fact that you could, in principle, discover evidence entailing ϕ should not in itself imply that you believe ϕ. This way of reconciling Stalnaker’s proposed axioms with an evidence-based account of knowledge— namely, by carefully distinguishing between knowledge and knowability—is the focus of the remainder of this paper. We begin by deﬁning a class of models rich enough to interpret both of these modalities at once.","x":-31,"y":1179,"width":793,"height":419},

Unlike Stalnaker, however, we work with the language LK,2,B and take as our “basic logic of knowledge” the system ELK,2 = S5K + S42 + (KI), where (KI) denotes the axiom scheme Kϕ → 2ϕ. As noted in Section 2.1, the evidence-in-hand con- ception of knowledge captured by the semantics for K is based on the premise that evidence-in-hand is completely transparent to the agent. That is, the agent is aware that she has the evidence she does and of what it entails and does not entail. In this sense, the agent is fully introspective with regard to the evidence-in-hand, and as such, K naturally emerges as an S5-type modality. 3It is not hard to see that [[2ϕ]]U = int([[ϕ]]U ) as one might expect; however, since the closure of [[ϕ]]U need not be a subset of U, we have [[3ϕ]]U = cl([[ϕ]]U ) ∩U. 4This reading suggests a strong link to conditional belief modalities, which are meant to capture an agent’s revised beliefs about how the world was before learning the new information. More precisely, a conditional belief formula Bϕ ψ is read as “if the agent would learn ϕ, then she would come to believe that ψ was the case (before the learning)” [7, p. 14]. Borrowing this interpretation, we might say that 2ϕ represents hypothetical, conditional knowledge of ϕ where the condition consists in having some piece of evidence V entailing ϕ as evidence-in-hand: “if the agent were to have V as evidence-in-hand, she would know ϕ was the case (before having had the evidence)”. 94 Logic and Topology for Knowledge, Knowability, and Belief The system ELK,2 was deﬁned by Bjorndahl [12] and shown to be exactly the logic of topological subset spaces. Theorem 1 ([12]). ELK,2 is a sound and complete axiomatization of LK,2 with respect to the class of all topological subset spaces: for every ϕ ∈ LK,2, ϕ is provable in ELK,2 if and only if ϕ is valid in all topological subset models. We strengthen ELK,2 with the additional axiom schemes given in Table 3. Let SELK,2,B denote the (KB) ⊢ B(ϕ → ψ) → (Bϕ → Bψ) Distribution of belief (sPI) ⊢ Bϕ → KBϕ Strong positive introspection (KB) ⊢ Kϕ → Bϕ Knowledge implies belief (RB) ⊢ Bϕ → B2ϕ Responsible belief (wF) ⊢ Bϕ → 3ϕ Weak factivity (CB) ⊢ B(2ϕ ∨ 2¬2ϕ) Conﬁdent belief Table 3: Additional axioms schemes for SELK,2,B resulting logic. Schemes (sPI) and (KB) occur here just as they do in Stalnaker’s original system (Table 2), and though (KB) is not an axiom of Stal, it is derivable in that system. The remaining axioms involve the 2 modality and thus cannot themselves be part of Stalnaker’s system; however, if we forget the distinction between 2 and K (and between 3 and ˆK), all of them do hold in Stal, as made precise in Proposition 2. Proposition 2. Let t : LK,2,B → LK,B be the map that replaces each instance of 2 with K. Then for every ϕ that is an instance of an axiom scheme from Table 3, we have ⊢Stal t(ϕ). Proof. This is trivial for (sPI), (KB), and (RB). The scheme (KB) follows immediately from the fact that Stal validates KD45B. After applying t, (wF) becomes Bϕ → ˆKϕ, which follows easily from the fact that ⊢Stal Bϕ ↔ ˆKKϕ. Finally, under t, (CB) becomes B(Kϕ ∨ K¬Kϕ), which follows directly from the aforementioned equivalence together with the fact that ⊢S4K ˆKK(Kϕ ∨ K¬Kϕ). Thus, modulo the distinction between knowledge and knowablity, we make no assumptions beyond what follows from Stalnaker’s own stipulations. Of course, the distinction between knowledge and knowability is crucial for us. Responsible belief differs from full belief in that K is replaced by 2, exactly as motivated in Section 2.1; it says that if you are sure of ϕ, then you must also be sure that there is some evidence that entails ϕ. Weak factivity and conﬁdent belief do not directly correspond to any of Stalnaker’s axioms, but they are necessary to establish an analogue of Stalnaker’s reduction of belief to knowledge (Proposition 3). Of course, one need not adopt these principles; indeed, rejecting them allows one to assent to the spirit of Stalnaker’s premises without committing oneself to his conclusion that belief can be deﬁned out of knowledge (or knowability). We return in Section 4 to consider weaker logics that omit one or both of (wF) and (CB). Weak factivity can be understood, given (KI), as a strengthening of the formula Bϕ → ˆKϕ (which is provable in Stal). Intuitively, it says that if you are certain of ϕ, then ϕ must be compatible with all the available evidence (in hand or not). Thus, while belief is not required to be factive—you can believe false things—(wF) does impose a weaker kind of connection to the world—you cannot believe knowably false things. A. Bjorndahl & A. ¨Ozg¨un 95 Conﬁdent belief expresses a kind of faith in the justiﬁcatory power of evidence. Consider the dis- junction 2ϕ ∨ 2¬2ϕ, which says that ϕ is either knowable or, if not, that you could come to know that it is unknowable. This is equivalent to the negative introspection axiom for the 2 modality, and does not hold in general; topologically speaking, it fails at the boundary points of the extension of 2ϕ—where no measurement can entail ϕ yet every measurement leaves open the possibility that some further measure- ment will. What (CB) stipulates is that the agent is sure that they are not in such a “boundary case”—that every formula ϕ is either knowable or, if not, knowably unknowable. Stalnaker’s reduction of belief to knowledge has an analogue in this setting: every formula in LK,2,B is provably equivalent to a formula in LK,2 via the following equivalence. Proposition 3. The formula Bϕ ↔ K32ϕ is provable in SELK,2,B. Proof. We present an abridged derivation: 1. Bϕ → 32ϕ (RB), (wF) 2. KBϕ → K32ϕ (NecK), (KK) 3. Bϕ → KBϕ (sPI) 4. Bϕ → K32ϕ CPL: 2, 3 5. B(2ϕ ∨ 2¬2ϕ) (CB) 6. (2ϕ ∨ 2¬2ϕ) → (32ϕ → ϕ) (T2), CPL 7. B(2ϕ ∨ 2¬2ϕ) → B(32ϕ → ϕ) (NecK), (KB), (KB) 8. B(32ϕ → ϕ) CPL: 5, 7 9. B32ϕ → Bϕ (KB) 10. K32ϕ → B32ϕ (KB) 11. K32ϕ → Bϕ CPL: 9, 10 12. Bϕ ↔ K32ϕ CPL: 4, 11. Thus, rather than being identiﬁed with the “epistemic possibility of knowledge” [33] as in Stalnaker’s framework, to believe ϕ in this framework is to know that the knowability of ϕ is unfalsiﬁable. This is a bit of a mouthful, so consider for a moment the meaning of the subformula 32ϕ: in the informal language of evidence, this says that every piece of evidence is compatible not only with the truth of ϕ, but with the knowability of ϕ. In other words: no possible measurement can rule out the prospect that some further measurement will deﬁnitively establish ϕ. To believe ϕ, according to Proposition 3, is to know this. This equivalence also tells us exactly how to extend topological subset space semantics to the lan- guage LK,2,B: (X, x,U) |= Bϕ iff (X, x,U) |= K32ϕ iff (∀y ∈ U)(y ∈ cl(int([[ϕ]]U ))) iff U ⊆ cl(int([[ϕ]]U )). Thus, the agent believes ϕ at (x,U) just in case the interior of [[ϕ]]U is dense in U. The collection of sets that have dense interiors on U forms a ﬁlter,5 making it a good mathematical notion of largeness: sets with dense interior can be thought of as taking up “most” of the space. This provides an appealing intuition for the semantics of belief that runs parallel to that for knowledge: the agent knows ϕ at (x,U) iff ϕ is true at all points in U, whereas the agent believes ϕ at (x,U) iff ϕ is true at most points in U. 5A nonempty collection of subsets forms a ﬁlter if it is closed under taking supersets and ﬁnite intersections. 96 Logic and Topology for Knowledge, Knowability, and Belief As mentioned in the introduction, this interpretation of belief as “truth at most points” (in a given domain) was ﬁrst studied by Baltag et al. as a topologically natural, evidence-based notion of belief [4]. Though their motivation and conceptual underpinning differ from ours, the semantics for belief we have derived in this section essentially coincide with those given in [4]. We discuss this connection further in Section 5. 3.1 Technical results Let (EQ) denote the scheme Bϕ ↔ K32ϕ. It turns out that this equivalence is not only provable in SELK,2,B, but in fact it characterizes SELK,2,B as an extension of ELK,2. To make this precise, let EL + K,2 = ELK,2 + (EQ). We then have: Proposition 4. EL+ K,2 and SELK,2,B prove the same theorems. From this it is not hard to establish soundness and completeness of SELK,2,B: Theorem 5. SELK,2,B is a sound and complete axiomatization of LK,2,B with respect to the class of topological subset models: for every ϕ ∈ LK,2,B, ϕ is valid in all topological subset models if and only if ϕ is provable in SELK,2,B. Much work in belief representation takes the logical principles of KD45B for granted (see, e.g., [24, 6, 15]). An important feature of SELK,2,B is that it derives these principles: Proposition 6. For every ϕ ∈ LB, if ⊢KD45B ϕ, then ⊢SELK,2,B ϕ. In fact, KD45B is not merely derivable in our logic—it completely characterizes belief as interpreted in topological models. That is, KD45B proves exactly the validities expressible in the language LB: Theorem 7. KD45B is a sound and complete axiomatization of LB with respect to the class of all topo- logical subset spaces: for every ϕ ∈ LB, ϕ is provable in KD45B if and only if ϕ is valid in all topological subset models. Soundness follows easily from the above. The proof of completeness is more involved; it can be found in the full version of this paper.","x":956,"y":2276,"width":651,"height":659},
		{"id":"d5d9ff12d22e83d0","type":"text","text":"5 **Conclusion and Discussion** \nWhen we think of knowledge as what is entailed by the “available evidence”, a tension between two foundational principles proposed by Stalnaker emerges. First, that whatever the available evidence en- tails is believed (Kϕ → Bϕ), and second, that what is believed is believed to be entailed by the available evidence (Bϕ → BKϕ). In the former case, it is natural to interpret “available” as, roughly speaking, 8A subset S of a topological space is called nowhere dense if its closure has empty interior: int(cl(S)) = /0. 9Given a subset A of a topological space X, we say that a property P holds for almost all points in A just in case A ⊆∗ {x : P(x)}. A. Bjorndahl & A. ¨Ozg¨un 99 “currently in hand”, whereas in the latter, intuition better accords with a broader interpretation of avail- ability as referring to any evidence one could potentially access. Being careful about this distinction leads to a natural division between what we might call “knowl- edge” and “knowability”; the space of logical relationships between knowledge, knowability, and belief turns out to be subtle and interesting. We have examined several logics meant to capture some of these relationstips, making essential use of topological structure, which is ideally suited to the representation of evidence and the epistemic/doxastic attitudes it informs. In this reﬁned setting, belief can also be deﬁned in terms of knowledge and knowability, provided we take on two additional principles, “weak factivity” (wF) and “conﬁdent belief” (CB); in this case, the semantics for belief have a particularly appealing topological character: roughly speaking, a proposition is believed just in case it is true in most possible alternatives, where “most” is interpreted topologically as “everywhere except on a nowhere dense set”. This interpretation of belief ﬁrst appeared in the topological belief semantics presented in [4]: Baltag et al. take the believed propositions to be the sets with dense interiors in a given evidential topology. Interestingly, however, although these semantics essentially coincide with those we present in Section 3, the motivations and intuitions behind the two proposals are quite different. Baltag et al. start with a subbase model in which the (subbasic) open sets represent pieces of evidence that the agent has obtained directly via some observation or measurement. They do not distinguish between evidence-in-hand and evidence-out-there as we do; moreover, the notion of belief they seek to capture is that of justiﬁed belief, where “justiﬁcation”, roughly speaking, involves having evidence that cannot be defeated by any other available evidence. (They also consider a weaker, defeasible type of knowledge, correctly justiﬁed be- lief, and obtain topological semantics for it under which Stalnaker’s original system Stal is sound and complete.) The fact that two rather different conceptions of belief correspond to essentially the same topological interpretation is, we feel, quite striking, and deserves a closer look. Despite the elegance of this topological characterization of belief, our investigation of the interplay between knowledge, knowability, and belief naturally leads to consideration of weaker logics in which belief is not interpreted in this way. In particular, we focus on the principles (wF) and (CB) and what is lost by their omission. Again we rely on topological subset models to interpret these logics, proposing novel semantic machinery to do so. This machinery includes the introduction of the doxastic range and, perhaps more dramatically, a modiﬁcation to the semantic satisfaction relation ( |≈ ) that builds the topological notion of “almost everywhere” quantiﬁcation directly into the foundations of the semantics. We believe this approach is an interesting area for future research, and in this regard our soundness and completeness results may be taken as proof-of-concept.","x":-4,"y":1968,"width":711,"height":342},

		{"id":"2c87205b854f1809","type":"text","text":"Based on your notes, you could use the proxy of the knowledge unit to model in the topological axioms by employing the framework of topological subset spaces to distinguish between knowledge as evidence-in-hand and knowability as potential evidence. This distinction is crucial for understanding the interplay between knowledge, knowability, and belief in the topological framework.\n\nIn the topological subset space models, knowledge is represented by the evidence currently available to an agent (evidence-in-hand), while knowability is represented by the potential evidence that could be obtained (evidence-out-there). This allows for a trimodal logic that includes knowledge (K), knowability (2), and belief (B), with specific axioms and rules that govern the relationships between these modalities.\n\nFor instance, the axiom Kϕ → 2ϕ (where ϕ is a proposition) captures the idea that if something is known, then it is also knowable. The axiom Bϕ → 3ϕ (weak factivity) suggests that if something is believed, then it is not ruled out by any available evidence. The axiom B(2ϕ ∨ 2¬2ϕ) (confident belief) implies that an agent believes that for any proposition ϕ, it is either knowable or its unknowability is knowable.\n\nTo model these axioms within the topological framework, you would define a topological space with a set of points representing possible worlds and a topology representing the available evidence. The epistemic range of an agent at a given point would be a subset of this space, representing the evidence-in-hand. The knowability modality would be interpreted using the interior operator in topology, reflecting the potential evidence that could be obtained.\n\nBy using this topological approach, you can create a formal model that captures the nuances of knowledge, knowability, and belief as discussed in your notes, and explore the logical consequences of various axioms and principles within this model. This model can then be used to analyze and refine the logical systems proposed by Stalnaker and others, as well as to develop novel topological semantics for weaker notions of belief where belief is not reducible to knowledge or knowability.","x":-23,"y":4364,"width":351,"height":452},
		{"id":"1094bde207a173c5","type":"text","text":"To expand on the idea of using a proxy for a knowledge unit to model topological axioms, let's consider the following steps and concepts that can be integrated into a cohesive framework:\n\n1. **Proxy Definition**: A proxy for a knowledge unit is an abstract representation that encapsulates essential information about the unit. This proxy could include various attributes such as type, properties, relationships, and metadata that are relevant to the knowledge domain.\n\n2. **Topological Space Construction**: Construct a topological space where each point represents a possible world or state of affairs. The topology on this space defines which sets of points are considered \"open\" and captures the notion of accessibility or potential knowledge.\n\n3. **Knowledge Representation**: In this space, actual knowledge (evidence-in-hand) can be represented by closed sets, which include their boundary points. These sets correspond to propositions that are known to be true in all accessible worlds.\n\n4. **Knowability Representation**: Potential knowledge (evidence-out-there) is represented by open sets. These sets correspond to propositions that could become known if additional evidence is obtained. The interior operator in topology can be used to model the transition from a state of unknowability to knowability.\n\n5. **Belief Representation**: Belief can be represented by dense sets, where points are closely packed. A belief is a proposition that is true in most accessible worlds, even if it's not true in all of them. Beliefs may not be fully supported by evidence but are not contradicted by the available evidence.\n\n6. **Modeling Axioms**: Using the topological representations of knowledge, knowability, and belief, you can model various axioms and principles. For example:\n   - **Knowledge Implies Knowability**: If a proposition is in a closed set (known), it must also be in the corresponding open set (knowable).\n   - **Weak Factivity**: If a proposition is in a dense set (believed), it cannot be in the complement of an open set (it's not knowably false).\n   - **Confident Belief**: If an agent believes a proposition, they also believe that the proposition is either knowable or its unknowability is knowable.\n\n7. **Navigating the Knowledge Graph**: Using the proxy representation, you can navigate the knowledge graph by moving from known propositions to knowable propositions and exploring beliefs that are consistent with the available evidence. This navigation can be guided by the topological structure and the logical principles encoded in the axioms.\n\n8. **Incorporating New Information**: As new evidence is obtained, the topological space can be updated to reflect the changes in knowledge and knowability. Proxies can be adjusted to incorporate this new information, ensuring that the knowledge graph remains accurate and up-to-date.\n\n9. **Reasoning and Inference**: The topological framework allows for sophisticated reasoning about the knowledge units. For instance, you can infer new knowledge based on the closure of sets or explore the implications of potential knowledge by considering the interiors of sets.\n\nBy using proxies for knowledge units and modeling them within a topological framework, you create a powerful abstraction that allows for the exploration and navigation of complex knowledge spaces. This approach provides a structured way to reason about knowledge, knowability, and belief, and can be applied to various domains where understanding the interplay between these concepts is crucial.","x":806,"y":3399,"width":901,"height":927},

Some strategies we can use include:\n\n1. **Data Normalization and Deduplication**: Review the entire data structure for redundant fields and ensure each data type serves a unique purpose. Remove any redundancy to minimize storage and maintain consistency.\n\n2. **Clear Hierarchies and Relationships**: Ensure that parent-child and peer-to-peer relationships within your data are clearly defined. This could involve setting up references between related entities such as `Location` and `QuestData`, `PilotState` and `ShipState`, or `PlanetData` and `Location`.\n\n3. **Indexing and Unique Identifiers**: Each object should have a unique identifier (`questId`, `pilotId`, `planetId`, etc.) to facilitate quick look-ups and references. Indexing common query fields can significantly enhance retrieval performance.\n\n4. **Separation of Static and Dynamic Data**: Separate data that changes frequently (dynamic data, such as `stats.status.health`) from data that is rarely changed (static data, like `heroCodex.historyBrief`). This can help in caching strategies and database design.\n\n5. **Effective Use of Data Types**: Ensure that each field's data type is appropriate for its use. For instance, boolean values for simple toggles, enumerated types for well-defined sets of options, and text for description fields.\n\n6. **Scalability Considerations**: Make sure that the data structures can handle the growth of the game. As the player base grows and the game universe expands, it's important for the ontology to scale without requiring major overhauls.\n\n7. **Efficient Handling of Time-based Data**: For fields representing time (`createdAt`, `responseAt`), utilize standardized formats and consider the time zone impacts if your game is played globally.\n\n8. **Consistency in Naming Conventions**: Maintain a consistent naming convention throughout the ontology to make it intuitive and manageable. This includes using camelCase or snake_case consistently and using self-explanatory field names.\n\n9. **Flat vs Nested Structures**: Decide on a consistent approach for structuring nested data. Deeply nested structures can make querying complex, but too flat structures may duplicate data.\n\n10. **Optimized for Query Patterns**: Organize and index the data based on common query patterns. If players often access information about their current quests and inventory, ensure those fields are easily queryable together.\n\n11. **Minimize Optional Fields**: Fields that are optional or frequently null can complicate queries and data integrity. Consider using default values or restructuring the ontology to avoid nulls.\n\n12. **Entity State Management**: For managing the states of entities like ships (`ShipState`) or pilots (`PilotState`), consider using a State Pattern to encapsulate varying behavior and status.\n\n13. **Modular Design**: Break down the game state into distinct modules where possible. For instance, `EncounterData` and `QuestData` could potentially be made more modular, allowing you to update or expand one module without impacting others.\n\n14. **Use of Look-Up Tables**: For data that requires decoding or reference (such as `rarity` in `Item`), look-up tables can be beneficial. This allows for a clean separation of concerns and a single source of truth.\n\n15. **Inheritance and Composition**: Leverage object-oriented principles where appropriate. If multiple entities share common attributes, they can inherit from a base class to avoid duplication.\n\n16. **Documentation and Comments**: Ensure that each component of the ontology is well-documented. Additional metadata like comments for engine rules (`metadata.commentsForEngine`) should be clearly described for developers' understanding.\n\nThrough these strategies, you can design an ontology that is robust, extendable, and caters to both current and future needs of the AIUniverse game state.","x":271,"y":4967,"width":974,"height":1224,"color":"6"},

		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"599000b6797cd3ff","type":"text","text":"Generalizable knowledge proofs refer to the ability to demonstrate knowledge or understanding that can be applied across various contexts, not just within a specific instance. In terms of software and game development, this concept translates to designing test cases that ensure code and system designs are robust, extensible, and not just tailored to a single, narrow use-case.\n\nApplying this to our TypeScript types for the game state ontology, we can create test cases that not only validate individual entities and their relationships but also the overarching system's adherence to the defined rules and logic. These test cases should be able to handle different kinds of input and simulate various game scenarios to verify the system's coherence and consistency.\n\n### Ontology Example\n\nLet's consider an ontology that includes players, quests, and items:\n\n```typescript\n// Example ontology:\n\n// Players embark on quests and collect items which affect their stats.\n\ntype Player {\n    id: string;\n    questLog: Quest[];\n    inventory: Item[];\n    stats: Stats;\n}\n\ntype Quest {\n    id: string;\n    name: string;\n    description: string;\n    reward: Item;\n    status: QuestStatus;\n}\n\ntype Item {\n    id: string;\n    name: string;\n    effects: Effect[];\n}\n\ntype Effect {\n    statAffected: keyof Stats;\n    magnitude: number;\n}\n\nenum QuestStatus {\n    NotStarted,\n    InProgress,\n    Completed\n}\n\n```\n\n### Valid Test Case for Generalizable Knowledge Proofs\n\nA valid test case would be to create a scenario where a player is assigned multiple quests, completes some of them, acquires items, and as a result, experiences changes in their stats. The test case should evaluate the following:\n\n1. Whether the quest assignments update the `Player`'s `questLog` appropriately.\n2. If completing a quest updates its status in the `questLog` and results in the correct `Item` being added to the `Player`'s `inventory`.\n3. If the `effects` of the `Item` when used correctly alter the `Player`'s `stats`.\n4. The system should maintain integrity even when new types of quests and items are introduced.\n\nHere's an example test case structure:\n\n```typescript\ndescribe('Quest and Inventory System', () => {\n    test('Players can complete quests and receive valid rewards', () => {\n        // Arrange: Initialize a player with an empty quest log and inventory.\n        const player = new Player();\n        \n        // Act: Assign a new quest and mark it as completed.\n        const quest = new Quest('Dragon Slaying', 'Slay the mighty dragon', new Item('Sword of Truth'));\n        player.acceptQuest(quest);\n        player.completeQuest(quest);\n\n        // Assert: Check that the quest status is 'Completed' and reward is in the player's inventory.\n        expect(player.getQuestStatus(quest)).toBe(QuestStatus.Completed);\n        expect(player.inventory).toContain(quest.reward);\n\n        // Act: Use the reward item, which has an effect of increasing the player's 'attack' stat.\n        player.useItem(quest.reward);\n\n        // Assert: Check that the player's stats have changed according to the item's effects.\n        expect(player.stats.attack).toBeGreaterThan(originalAttackValue);\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis test case is suitable as a generalizable knowledge proof because:\n\n1. **It's Reusable**: The structure can be reused to test different quests and items without changing the fundamental logic of the test.\n2. **It's Flexible**: This test case doesn’t make assumptions about the specifics of quests, items, nor their effects, allowing different types and instances to be tested.\n3. **Extensibility**: It can be extended or modified to include additional rules (e.g., quests with prerequisites).\n4. **Adaptability**: If the ontology evolves, the test case should still validate core functionality assuming the rules governing quests and items remain consistent.\n\nThis test case, therefore, not only validates specific program behaviors but also serves as a proof of the system's application of knowledge in various scenarios, ensuring that the ontology is capable of handling generalized game states.","x":546,"y":8049,"width":1410,"height":2194,"color":"6"},

Similar to the ontology developed for the game state, this platform would need an ontology representing entities like research studies, datasets, researchers, and institutions, while ensuring the integrity, discoverability, and reusability of the data.\n\n### Scientific Ontology Example:\n\nTo illustrate this, let's consider a simple ontology for a scientific research-sharing platform:\n\n```typescript\n// Basic ontology for scientific research-sharing:\n\ntype ResearchStudy {\n    id: string;\n    title: string;\n    abstract: string;\n    authors: Researcher[];\n    dataSets: DataSet[];\n    citations: ResearchStudy[];\n    fieldOfStudy: string;\n}\n\ntype DataSet {\n    id: string;\n    name: string;\n    description: string;\n    relatedStudies: ResearchStudy[];\n    accessDetails: AccessDetails;\n}\n\ntype Researcher {\n    id: string;\n    name: string;\n    affiliation: Institution;\n    publishedStudies: ResearchStudy[];\n}\n\ntype Institution {\n    id: string;\n    name: string;\n    researchers: Researcher[];\n    publishedStudies: ResearchStudy[];\n}\n\ntype AccessDetails {\n    accessPolicy: AccessPolicy;\n    accessURL: string;\n}\n\nenum AccessPolicy {\n    OpenAccess,\n    Restricted,\n    PaidAccess\n}\n\n```\n\n### Valid Test Case for Generalizable Knowledge Proofs in Science:\n\nA valid test case would evaluate multiple aspects of this scientific ontology:\n\n1. Whether new research studies are correctly registered with appropriate metadata (title, abstract, authors).\n2. If datasets are linked to their corresponding research studies and accessibility details are up-to-date.\n3. If the researcher's and institution's records accurately reflect their publications and associated datasets.\n4. Whether the system can handle the addition of new fields of study, policies, or types of research.\n\nSample test case structure for the research-sharing platform:\n\n```typescript\ndescribe('Research Data Sharing Platform', () => {\n    test('Registering and accessing a new research study', () => {\n        // Arrange: Create a researcher, institution, and dataset\n        const researcher = new Researcher(name: 'Jane Doe', affiliation: 'XYZ University');\n        const institution = new Institution(name: 'XYZ University', researchers: [researcher]);\n        const dataSet = new DataSet(name: 'Genome Data', accessDetails: new AccessDetails(AccessPolicy.OpenAccess, 'http://dataset-url.com'));\n\n        // Act: Register a new research study\n        const researchStudy = new ResearchStudy(title: 'Genomic Variations', abstract: 'Study of genetic variations in species', authors: [researcher], dataSets: [dataSet], fieldOfStudy: 'Genetics');\n        repository.registerStudy(researchStudy);\n\n        // Assert: Check that the study is correctly added with all its details\n        expect(repository.getStudyById(researchStudy.id)).toEqual(researchStudy);\n\n        // Assert: Cross-validation of researcher's, institution's and dataset's records \n        expect(researcher.publishedStudies).toContain(researchStudy);\n        expect(institution.publishedStudies).toContain(researchStudy);\n        expect(dataSet.relatedStudies).toContain(researchStudy);\n\n        // Act: Access dataset linked to the study\n        const accessDetails = repository.getDatasetAccessDetails(dataSet.id);\n\n        // Assert: Ensure correct access policy and URL for the dataset\n        expect(accessDetails.accessPolicy).toBe(AccessPolicy.OpenAccess);\n        expect(accessDetails.accessURL).toBe('http://dataset-url.com');\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThis test case demonstrates a generalizable proof of knowledge by ensuring that:\n\n1. **Data Integrity**: All relationships between entities (researcher, study, dataset) maintain integrity after operations like registering and linking studies and datasets.\n2. **System Flexibility**: The structure of the test permits the addition of new entities and relationships without changing the test's foundational logic.\n3. **Adaptability**: The test adapts to varying access policies and reflects changes in real-time (e.g., a dataset moving from Restricted to OpenAccess).\n\nIn a scientific context, such a test case ensures that the platform can handle the complex web of research data, authorship, and institutional affiliations—upholding the principle of knowledge sharing and collaboration in the scientific community.","x":2115,"y":8627,"width":1123,"height":1750,"color":"6"},

This Engram would then undergo a valuation process based on how it is engaged with in the academic community, taking into account both validation and appreciation over time, ultimately resulting in a value in DeSciWorld's native token, DST.\n\nIn this scenario, we’ll define TypeScript types to represent Engrams and outline a test case that exemplifies how the system would handle the submission, validation, and appreciation of knowledge.\n\n### TypeScript Types for the Ontology\n\n```typescript\n// Engram represents a piece of knowledge like a research question or data point\nexport type Engram = {\n    id: string;\n    content: string;\n    metadata: EngramMetadata;\n    validationScores: number[];\n    value: number;\n    owner: string; // Owning 'Nerd' represented by wallet address\n};\n\n// Metadata for Engram contains information about its subject, complexity, etc.\nexport type EngramMetadata = {\n    subject: string;\n    complexityLevel: number;\n    timestamp: number;\n    authorship: string;\n    references: string[]; // Array of IDs to related Engrams\n};\n\n// Submission of an Engram creates an instance and begins the validation process\nexport function submitEngram(content: string, metadata: EngramMetadata): Engram;\n\n// Validators review the Engram and give it a score\nexport function validateEngram(engramId: string, validatorId: string, score: number): void;\n\n// System calculates the appreciation value of the Engram over time based on interactions (usage metrics)\nexport function calculateAppreciation(engramId: string): void;\n```\n\n### Test Case for Submission and Validation\n\n```typescript\n// Import the necessary types and functions for test\nimport { Engram, submitEngram, validateEngram, calculateAppreciation } from './DeSciWorld';\n\ndescribe('Proof-of-Knowledge Mechanism', () => {\n    it('should handle the submission, validation, and appreciation of an Engram', () => {\n        // Submitting an Engram for a Study Question\n        const studyQuestionContent = \"How does dark matter influence galactic structures?\";\n        const metadata = {\n            subject: \"Astrophysics\", \n            complexityLevel: 5, \n            timestamp: Date.now(), \n            authorship: \"0xNERDAUTHOR\", \n            references: [\"0xENG123\"] // Assuming references to previously submitted Engrams\n        };\n\n        const engram = submitEngram(studyQuestionContent, metadata);\n\n        // Validating the Engram with scores from different validators\n        validateEngram(engram.id, \"0xVALIDATOR1\", 85);\n        validateEngram(engram.id, \"0xVALIDATOR2\", 90);\n        // ...further validations\n\n        // The system should calculate the initial value of the study question based on validation scores\n        const initialValue = engram.value;\n        expect(initialValue).toBeGreaterThan(0);\n\n        // Engram should appreciate in value based on usage metrics (simulated)\n        calculateAppreciation(engram.id);\n\n        // Mock interactions with the Engram to influence its value\n        for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {\n            // Simulates reads, shares, citations etc., normally aggregated from user activity\n            calculateAppreciation(engram.id);\n        }\n\n        // The appreciation calculation would be run on a set interval determined by the system, not in a for loop\n        const appreciatedValue = engram.value;\n        expect(appreciatedValue).toBeGreaterThan(initialValue);\n    });\n});\n```\n\nIn this test case, submitting an Engram initiates it with validation scores and a calculated initial value. The value appreciates over time based on 'interactions'. This example simulates those interactions to test the Engram's value increase, which should be appreciable at the end of the test.\n\nThis test case ensures that regardless of the specifics of the content and metadata (except for validating that it meets certain criteria for submission), Engrams are correctly logged, validated, and appreciated within the ecosystem, providing a kind of generalized proof of the knowledge encapsulated within the system. It establishes a reliable, scalable framework reflecting the academic rigor and validation processes while also manifesting an appreciation over time reflective of real-world academic impact.","x":4050,"y":8552,"width":2764,"height":1763,"color":"6"},
		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"46ab91cfd89c3110","type":"text","text":"Creating a new ontology using the provided type definitions, optimized for large-scale coherent states of play, involves carefully structuring the information to support a vast number of concurrent interactions while maintaining performance and data consistency. An efficient ontology is crucial for game integrity, player experience, and data analytics.\n\nLet's define the new ontology with considerations for high-performance querying, minimal redundancy, and clarity:\n\n### Primary Game Entities\n\n1. **Universe**:\n   - Entities: Collection of all in-game entities (planets, pilot states, ship states, etc.)\n\n2. **Player**:\n   - Account information\n   - In-game nickname and guild affiliations.\n   - PilotState and ShipState: Corresponding state data tied to the player's in-game character and assets.\n\n3. **Planet**:\n   - Identifier and discovery information\n   - Location details\n   - Environmental and historical scan data\n   - Control status (e.g., Is the planet controlled by a faction)\n\n4. **Item**:\n   - Modifier attributes (weight, rarity, credit value)\n   - Functional descriptions for AI and Gameplay (use analysis)\n\n5. **Quest**:\n   - Quest-related details and historical recounts\n   - Associated locations, objectives, and difficulty levels\n   - Current status and completed activity logs\n\n6. **Encounter**:\n   - Encounter-specific information, narratives, and results\n   - Game-relevant metadata for engine interpretation\n\n### Secondary and Auxiliary Entities\n\n1. **Inventory**:\n   - Collection of items and resources allocated to players or ships\n\n2. **Guild**:\n   - Guild identifier, name and its related data, including member lists and assets\n\n3. **Broadcasts and Announcements**:\n   - AIUBroadcasts containing global messages, quipux rewards, and story elements\n\n4. **Communications**:\n   - ChatData containing message exchanges for various communications channels in-game\n\n### Dynamic Interactions\n\n1. **Quest Assignments and Progress**:\n   - Players are assigned quests that direct gameplay, with objectives and progression managed dynamically.\n   - API data on quest status and updates are reflected across relevant entities in the universe.\n\n2. **Encounters**:\n   - Players can trigger encounters, with outcomes affecting player data, inventory, and universe state.\n   - Encounters lead to potential quest updates and broadcasting of significant universe events.\n\n3. **Player Interactions**:\n   - Every player action, trade, dialogue, and movement is an interaction leading to potential state changes. Coherence is maintained across player, inventory, quest, and universe entities.\n\n4. **Environmental Changes**:\n   - Planetary discoveries and environmental data affect potential player income and universe exploration. These changes are reflected in broadcast announcements and internal universe data.\n   \n5. **Economy and Trade**:\n   - Economy and trading systems leverage inventory and player state to facilitate asset management and progression.\n\n### Ontology Management Strategies:\n\n1. **Optimization for Query Performance**:\n   - Index relevant query fields such as player IDs, quest IDs, location identifiers, etc.\n   - Use caching layers for frequent look-ups.\n\n2. **Data Structure Hierarchy**:\n   - Organize data to reflect hierarchy (e.g., Universe -> Planets -> Locations -> Quests)\n\n3. **Data Segregation**:\n   - Static and dynamic data separated to allow efficient updating and caching.\n\n4. **Event-Driven Architecture**:\n   - Game state changes triggered by player actions are events, which propagate through the state management system to update dependent entities coherently.\n\n5. **Data Versioning and Snapshots**:\n   - Use version control systems to manage and track changes in game state for debugging and rollback capabilities.\n\n6. **State Consistency Validation**:\n   - Implement routine checks to ensure data integrity across related entities and their interactions.\n\n7. **Flexibility and Scalability**:\n   - Allow for modular expandability to handle game universe growth.\n\nThis ontology forms a comprehensive model of the game state focusing on scalability, coherence, and extensibility. It is generic enough to adapt to different genres and complexities, and is structured to maintain both top-level coherence (integrity and consistency of the entire game world) and fine-grained details (specific item properties or individual player stats).","x":1542,"y":6096,"width":1914,"height":2237,"color":"6"}
