In this modification, we introduced a new variable `tokenId` in the `Athlete` struct to store the ERC721 token ID representing the athlete's profile. We also added another variable `athleteProfileToken` of type `IERC721` to interact with the ERC721 token contract representing athlete profiles.

The `registerAthlete` function is updated to include the `_tokenId` argument representing the ERC721 token ID. It transfers the athlete's profile NFT from the athlete's wallet to the `LudusSocialGraph` contract. The function first checks if the NFT is owned by the caller.

Now, when an athlete registers, both the Ludus tokens and the athlete's profile NFT are distributed.

Please note that you need to import the IERC721 interface from the OpenZeppelin library in order to use it in your contract.
