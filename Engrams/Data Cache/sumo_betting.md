In a scenario where the inflation of the token is exclusively determined by the amount of tokens staked for betting, and sumo's binary outcome allows for token distribution, the seigniorage profit wouldn't necessarily come from the loss of bettors but instead from the inflation mechanism itself. Let's see how this could work:

1. **Staking Tokens for Bets**: Users bet on sumo matches by staking tokens. The total amount of tokens staked influences the inflation rate of the currency, leading to an increase in the total supply of tokens.

2. **Betting Outcome and Inflation**: When a sumo match concludes, the outcome - win or lose - is binary, and this can be used to distribute the new tokens created due to inflation. For example, those who bet on the winning side could receive a proportionally higher share of the newly created tokens.

3. **Seigniorage Profits**: Unlike traditional betting systems where losing bettors' stakes are distributed among the winners (i.e., zero-sum), in this system, nobody has to lose tokens if their bet was wrong. Instead, the profit comes from an increase in each user's token holdings due to their share of the newly minted inflation tokens - this is their seigniorage profit.

4. **Equal Distribution**: If the objective is for nobody to lose, even those who bet on the losing side, a part of the newly minted tokens could be distributed among them too, but possibly at a lower rate than winners. This maintains incentive to predict correctly but also isn't punishing.

This mechanism encourages participation in the betting system because everyone can potentially gain from the system, regardless of their betting outcome. This also stimulates token velocity and operational dynamics in the economy since betting becomes a 'mining' mechanism itself. 

It's important to note that this model's sustainability and stability depend on consistent participation and a balance in the token inflation rate, requiring careful economic modelling and potentially, adaptive adjustment mechanisms.
