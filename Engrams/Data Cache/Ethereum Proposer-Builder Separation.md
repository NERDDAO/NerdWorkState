### _Conclusion_

PBS isn't a specific implementation, it's a design philosophy. It says that there are incentives for the division of labor and that protocol actors will delegate some responsibilities to more specialized external entities. The protocol's aim is to offer a reliable, as trustless as possible interface to ensure this delegation is smooth, fair, and inclusive. Without this, some actors might have an edge, leading to the centralization issues first observed with MEV before the PBS era. At its core, PBS emphasizes fairness and decentralization. While the exact elements to be integrated into the protocol will be seen in future Ethereum updates, Ethereum’s overarching goal remains clear: accessible, open, trustworthy stateful computing, overseen by a decentralized group of lightweight validators.
