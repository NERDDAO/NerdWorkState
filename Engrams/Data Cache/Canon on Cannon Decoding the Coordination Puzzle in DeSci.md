Imagine a cannon. The explosive force propelling a cannonball is immense. Yet, without a barrel guiding its path, that formidable blast could easily dissipate aimlessly. This analogy doesn't just apply to cannons but perfectly encapsulates the current wave in the scientific realm - decentralized science (DeSci).

The recent buzz around [LK-99](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008) has been hard to miss. The astounding discovery of room-temperature superconductors from everyday materials sent ripples across the online scientific community. In a domain where renowned figures often claim landmark discoveries, two Korean scientists, quietly laboring for two decades, managed to upend long-standing beliefs in material science, attracting immediate acclaim.

In a time where major names often make headlines, this was indeed a fresh perspective. Enthusiasts and premier research institutions alike [jumped into the fray](https://decrypt.co/151300/room-temperature-superconductor-race-shines-light-crypto-desci-movement). My curiosity led me to a [Telegram group](https://mirror.xyz/desciworld.eth/nYmHHWWKUG7n0i35ojJn0MuKggl-4DOAH4-dNouTVVI) centered on this discovery. Initial enthusiasm in August soon gave way to wider discussions in [X](https://twitter.com/) Spaces and collaborative research proposals. Yet, a hush descended on the group in just a fortnight. While a few solo endeavors continue on platforms like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/), the anticipated group synergy appears to have slowed.

In the world of DeSci, smooth coordination is of the essence. It's vital that every contributor remains in sync, channeling their energies purposefully and avoiding overlap. Just as crucial is the equitable allocation of value. **When individuals sense that their contributions are justly valued and rewarded, what were once mere side projects evolve into game-changing ventures.** **For DeSci to stand toe-to-toe with traditional science (TradSci), it requires not just talent and funding, but robust organizations to channel those towards desired outcomes.**

Drawing from my stint in innovation and product development, and after engaging with several notable DeSci entities, here are some insights into their coordination needs:

**1 - Organizational Structure & Efficiency**:

- Structures that can both grow and stay effective.
    
- Flexibility to adjust and evolve with _shifting needs_.

In The Grand Scheme, Every Team Is In A Race Of Its Own

**2 - Organizational Memory**:

- A system that maintains [organizational memory](https://lomads.medium.com/navigating-uncertainty-and-evolution-the-importance-of-mission-statements-and-organizational-f7d89147c215) to ensure that decisions, processes, and _historical context_ aren't lost despite personnel changes or a decentralized nature.
    

**3 - Permission Management**:

- Vital due to its decentralized nature; ensuring only authorized individuals can access certain data.
    

**4 - Transparency, Accountability, and Evaluation**:

- [_Open processes_](https://lomads.medium.com/thriving-in-the-web3-world-the-essential-guide-to-transparency-accountability-and-financial-5e7e8dc0695) in funding, hiring, and evaluations.
    
- Distinct criteria for gauging success at both macro and micro levels.
    

**5 - Incentives and Contribution Management**:

- Clear mechanisms for rewarding both specialized and broad contributions.
    
- Versatile reward structures that consider varying involvement levels.

Like Mario's Quest, Rewards Await the Right Moves

**6 - Financial Management**:

- [Proficient handling of finances](https://lomads.medium.com/thriving-in-the-web3-world-the-essential-guide-to-transparency-accountability-and-financial-5e7e8dc0695), be it crypto or traditional.
    
- Ensuring compliance and safeguarding transactions.
    

**7 - Governance and Decision-making**:

- Melding decentralization with efficacy, blending DAO elements with traditional hierarchies for balanced innovation and control.
    
- Prioritizing stakeholder input in major decisions while upholding operational agility.

Harness the Magical Powers of Melding

**8 - Integration of Tools**:

- Cohesive use of Web3 platforms.
    
- Minimizing redundancy through integrated tools.
