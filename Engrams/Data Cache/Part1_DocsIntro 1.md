# Understanding DeSciWorld

Decentralized Science (DeSci) is an area with rapid advancements, demonstrating the transformative power of blockchain in reshaping open research. DeSciWorld, an entity uniquely positioned within this context, advocates for infrastructure that can revolutionize research. To comprehend DeSciWorld fully, it unravels into four main sections:

1. Open Research and the Existence of DeSci
2. Embracing On-chain Science
3. Delving Into DeSci World
4. Empowering the DeScientist

Whether you aim to engage or simply understand DeSciWorld, take a moment to absorb the following insights.

**1: Open Research and the Existence of DeSci**

Open research, an underexploited resource in its early stages, stands to gain from a decentralized perspective. DeSci strives to create a fair, equitable landscape for funding, creating, managing, and disseminating scientific knowledge using decentralized technologies.

Decentralizing scientific processes has the potential to unlock global intellectual prowess. By shifting control from controlling entities to an unbiased, interested community, science realigns with its core principles through Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT).

**2: Embracing On-chain Science: Decentralized Science**

DeSci represents an innovative approach in scientific research and distribution, challenging traditional systems by leveraging decentralized methodologies. DeSci fosters a more inclusive and extensive ecosystem, protecting the democratization of knowledge and reinforcing transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility in scientific pursuits.

**3: Delving Into DeSci World**

DeSciWorld emerges as a platform where researchers can explore funding for decentralized research. The mission is clear - to connect the decentralized research community, foster global inclusivity, and ensure amicable integration with traditional research sectors.

**4: Empowering the DeScientist: Science.tech**

Created by DeSciWorld DAO, Science.tech is our mission in action to unlock the potential of open research. It provides tools and platforms to democratize knowledge and foster scientific innovation. Science.tech is a secure environment for research enthusiasts to host and manage their research initiatives, making science more transparent, efficient, and accessible to all.
