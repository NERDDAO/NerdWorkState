At Lomads, we understand that contributors in decentralized collectives should be empowered to focus on what truly matters: research, collaboration, and innovation. That's why we've built a unified dashboard designed to save time and boost efficiency by streamlining access management, monitoring, validation, and fund disbursal.

#### Seamless Access Management

Role-Ready Templates: Skip the setup hassle with predefined roles like Admins, Core Contributors, and more, that make operations smooth.

Discord Role Sync: Effortlessly import roles from Discord to set up workspaces with relevant members and specify task eligibility.

One-Stop Token Gating: Use membership Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) for easy access control across Notion and Discord channels.

#### Effortless Monitoring & Validation

Simple Submissions: Accept and manage submissions for tasks and eligibility applications in no time.

Clear Oversight: Keep tabs on task and milestone progress from a unified hub visible to core contributors.

Proof-of-Contribution: As work gets validated, automatically memorialize each member's contributions on their SBTs.

#### Streamlined Fund Disbursal

Multi-Treasury Management: Import or create a 'Safe' multi-sig wallet across various EVM chains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Optimism, Base, Celo, and Arbitrum with ease.

Unified Transaction View Across Chains: View all your multi-sig wallet transactions across chains from one dashboard, making financial tracking simple.

Smart Financials: Benefit from auto-labeled statements with straightforward editing and downloading options.

Flexible Payments: Opt for milestone-based, task-based, or recurring payments to fit your operational needs.

Task Import & Compensation: Pull tasks from GitHub or Trello and attach compensation effortlessly.

Sweat Points for Bootstrappers: Record contributions using "Sweat Points" and easily compensate later with a few clicks.
