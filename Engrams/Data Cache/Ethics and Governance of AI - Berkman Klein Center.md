# Ethics and Governance of AI



The rapidly growing capabilities and increasing presence of AI-based systems in our lives raise pressing questions about the impact, governance, ethics, and accountability of these technologies around the world. How can we narrow the knowledge gap between AI “experts” and the variety of people who use, interact with, and are impacted by these technologies? How do we harness the potential of AI systems while ensuring that they do not exacerbate existing inequalities and biases, or even create new ones?

At the Berkman Klein Center, a wide range of research projects, community members, programs, and perspectives seek to address the big questions related to the ethics and governance of AI. Our first two and half years of work in this area are reviewed in "[5 Key Areas of Impact](https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2019-10/ethics-and-governance-ai-initiative-berkman-klein-5-key-areas-impact)," and a selection of work from across our community is found below.
