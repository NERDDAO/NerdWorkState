# Get started with DeSciWorld DAO

DeSciWorld DAO was established to nurture the three fundamental pillars that form the Decentralized Science (DeSci) backbone: Community, Researchers, and Protocols. The objective is to engage all DeSci participants in pushing the boundaries of the field. 

## Researchers

Early-stage research, particularly in less mainstream disciplines, often finds it challenging to secure necessary funds. DeSciWorld, recognizing this hurdle, provides researchers with a comprehensive suite of tools to alleviate this obstacle. Our ultimate goal is to cultivate a robust ecosystem of open researchers to advance under-researched scientific fields.

## Protocols

Numerous successful DeSci protocols have been developed by skilled contributors in the field. DeSciWorld offers access to these protocols through the Terminal, which aims to provide tools necessary both to budding and established projects.

## Cause Funders

Cause funders are another integral part of the DeSci ecosystem. They provide important resources that enable researchers to explore new ideas and expand the boundaries of knowledge. At DeSciWorld, we aim to create a platform that encourages and facilitates interaction and collaboration between researchers and cause funders.
