Key Insights:
1. Ethereum plans to reimagine its core protocol and bring back certain aspects of the process by ensuring that proposers obtain blocks from builders. This would help in reducing the vulnerabilities seen in the current relay system.
2. Several ePBS designs are being researched to incorporate proposer-builder separation. Concepts like the two-slot model, usage of a payload-timeliness committee, use of an inclusion list, and a slot auction model are some of the ways being considered to reintegrate PBS on-chain.
3. Various ideas are being explored to incrementally lighten the responsibilities of relays to facilitate Optimistic Relaying V1 and V2. The end goal for Optimistic Relaying leans more towards a structure similar to the payload-timeliness committee model.
4. There are proposals to leverage the newly created roles of builders in the Ethereum protocol to perform higher computational tasks like scaling functionality or constructing large blocks (as proposed in Danksharding).
5. The concept of Protocol-Enforced Proposer Commitments (PEPC), introduced by Ethereum Foundation researcher Barnabé Monnot, aims to grant proposers an increased role in block building by adding extra validity conditions for a block.
