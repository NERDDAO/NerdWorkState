In order to distribute seigniorage based on onchain sumo bets, the Sumo seignioragetor Kneuron would follow a potential process such as:

1. **Analyzing Sumo Betting Data**: The first step in the process would involve analyzing the data from onchain sumo bets. This could include looking at who made the bets, how much they bet, and the outcomes of the matches they bet on.

2. **Determining Profit/Loss**: Once the sumo betting data has been analyzed, the next step would be to calculate each bettor's profit or loss. This would involve comparing the total amount bet to the total amount won or lost.

3. **Calculating Seigniorage Distribution**: After the profit/loss for each bettor has been determined, the kneuron would then calculate the distribution of seigniorage. This could be done in several ways. For example, it could be distributed proportionally based on the amount bet, or it could be weighted more towards those who made profitable bets.

4. **Distributing Seigniorage**: Once the distribution of seigniorage has been calculated, the final step would be to actually distribute it to the bettors. This would likely involve transferring the seigniorage directly to their onchain wallets.

This execution assumes a scenario where betting profits and losses directly influence the distribution of seigniorage. Different parameters could be set depending on the demands and goals of the platform users and the stakeholders related to the sumo betting system.
