To conceptualize this AI-Driven Knowledge Management using the Lomads protocol into a hyperstructure, we need substantial technological integration and a systematic process that is interconnected, interactive, and adaptable. 

Let's refer to this hyperstructure as the **Hyper Knowledge and Contribution Ecosystem** (HKCE).

The HKCE would be a supra-system that functions as an integrative framework for organizations, making their operations more streamlined, performance-based, and intuitive. Here's how it could unfold:

1. **Decentralized Ledger of Contributions:** At the core, the HKCE would integrate the blockchain-based ledger of the Lomads protocol, logging and rewarding every contribution made within the organization with SBTs. 

2. **AI-Powered Analytics & Forecasting:** This core will be appended by an AI-driven analytical layer that makes sense of the data in the ledger. It will use pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms to predict performance trends, optimize workflows, and suggest more effective collaboration or project management strategies.

3. **Dynamic Querying System:** A third layer of the hyperstructure will be an advanced querying system that can provide quick and in-depth insights about individual and team performance, underlying dynamics, contribution history, etc. This system can be used anytime by leaders or HR personnel to make informed decisions.

4. **Adaptive Feedback Mechanism:** The hyperstructure will also integrate a feedback mechanism that learns from its past predictions and suggestions, the resulting outcomes, and feedback from users to adapt and improve its algorithms.

5. **Open Developer Ecosystem:** A final but essential layer will be an open ecosystem for developers to build extensions or applications that can use the data from the HKCE in innovative and productive ways to better serve the organization or its contributors. 

6. **Integrative Interface:** All these subsystems of the HKCE will be presented through an intuitive user interface that is accessible and easy-to-use for everyone within the organization. 

By bringing together blockchain technology, AI-powered analytics, advanced querying, and adaptive learning, this hyperstructure creates a comprehensive solution that fosters a transparent, fair, and data-driven workplace culture.
