Lomads: CommandCentral for Collectives

Decentralized collectives are the cornerstone of a new, collaborative economy. However, they suffer from crippling inefficiencies — disjointed platforms, manual fund allocation, and a lack of real-time validation for contributors.

Lomads aims to serve as the central nervous system for decentralized collectives, particularly in the burgeoning and transformative sectors of Decentralized Science (DeSci) and Open Source. We provide a unified platform for real-time monitoring and validation, access management, and streamlined fund distribution. Our solution seamlessly integrates with popular tools like Notion, Discord, GitHub, and Trello, lowering the barrier to entry. Both DeSci and open source sectors share a common need: to understand how their knowledge or systems have evolved and who has contributed what. Lomads uniquely addresses this by creating a 'knowledge ledger' and recognizing contributions with membership soulbond tokens linked to specific projects.

"We envision a world where decentralized collectives operate as efficiently and smoothly as any centralized enterprise. Lomads is the tool poised to make this vision a reality."

Market Opportunity

This represents a colossal market opportunity. Open-source companies have already shattered investor skepticism, scaling to multi-billion-dollar valuations—look no further than Red Hat's $32B acquisition or MongoDB's $4B valuation. Meanwhile, DeSci is poised to transform the inefficient $100B+ science funding landscape. Flourishing projects like Molecule ($12.7M), VibeBio ($12M), and VitaDAO ($4.1M) have already attracted substantial seed funding.

Monetization & Token Design

Catering to collectives of all sizes, our pricing tiers range from a free Starter package to a Pro option at $250/month, each with a free transaction slab before additional fees apply. We offer custom API access for Pro users. Furthermore, our tokenized business model enhances customer alignment. Our platform is powered by our native token, LMD, and aims for progressive decentralization. The token will have various utilities, accessible by staking, such as reducing platform fees and participating in platform governance.

Team

The Lomads team boasts unparalleled expertise across a range of critical domains. Leading the charge is Nishant, who brings a wealth of innovation management experience from consulting for industry giants like P&G and Intel, and leading Consumer Appliance Innovations at Godrej. Complementing this, Naman, a Tech Lead from deep-tech startup Tortoise, adds his expertise in data science and machine learning, honed through research and teaching stints at Télécom Paris. Beyond our co-founders, our core team is equally stellar: Rajiv's fintech background from JPMorgan Chase, Zélie's decade-long experience in UX/UI design, and Jonathan's proficiency in full-stack development and Solidity contribute to a holistic skill set. From Frederic's operational excellence to Anais' financial acumen, and Tamaghna's product development insights, the team is rounded out by specialized growth specialists in our Growth DAO.

Funding

We've successfully raised $320,000 in a pre-seed round from Outlier Ventures and several high-profile angel investors. We are now in the process of raising a $1.6M seed round (PreSale 1), with the first investment already secured from Arjan, the founder of Blockstart Investments.

As the landscapes of open-source and DeSci continue to expand, so does the need for effective decentralized management. Lomads aims to lead this frontier, continually innovating to meet the needs of an evolving decentralized economy.
