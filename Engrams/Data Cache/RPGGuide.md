# Beginner's Guide to Tabletop RPGs

If you're reading this then somewhere, somehow, you decided that role-playing games might be a pastime that you could enjoy. Perhaps you have been involved with video game RPGs and wanted to see where those came from, or maybe you saw some people playing a game at your local library or game store, or you may have seen the hobby lampooned or referenced on a popular television show. Regardless of how you got the idea to become involved, this guide seeks to help you get started as painlessly as possible.

In this guide, we are going to cover everything from choosing your first game to getting in touch with your local role-playing community. We’ll also cover the basics of actually preparing for and playing a game in your own home. Now, without further fanfare, let’s get to the good parts.

The **[Glossary](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/glossary)** explains many of the common terms and abbreviations that appears within the hobby.

## Using this Guide

Don't feel that you must read this guide in order or to completion. There may be useful information in every section; however, f you already know about dice then there is no reason to read about them. Make use of the table of contents to the right and head straight for the information that you need.

# Role-playing in a Nutshell

Not actually in a shell, you clown, but the general concept. Roleplaying combines elements of improvisational theater/comedy, oral storytelling, and board/miniatures games. The result is something that is more than the sum of its parts. If that sounds like it might be complicated then don't despair, it's far easier to get the hang of than you might think.

Role-playing is a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but most of us can agree that it all comes down to imagining something with a group of people. When you sit around a table with some friends and take on the roles of characters that exist only in your shared imagination then you're role-playing. Traditionally the way we go about doing this is to designate one person as the Guide to lead the game and control things behind the scenes while the remaining players take turns describing how they interact with the world that the Guide manages. There are other ways to handle this, but that is beyond the scope of this guide.

The thing that sets tabletop role-playing and LARP apart from freeform role-playing, like the make-believe enjoyed by children, is that role-playing games have codified rules. What these rules entail varies from game to game, but they generally outline the mechanical processes followed by players when they want to do something and what happens when they do. The rules help frame the narration provided by the Guide and players in a way that is fair. The best games also have rules that help to inspire and lead you through a great and engaging narrative. We’ll go into the nuts and bolts of how this all fits together later on in this guide.

> ---
> 
> Guide isn't the only title for the person that leads the game. Each game likes to give this position a unique title and over the years this person has been called a Storyteller, Dungeon Master, Game Master, Administrator, Referee, Director, Master of Ceremonies, and a few dozen other titles. For the purposes of this guide, we are going to call them a Guide because that’s what they do, they guide the other players through the experience.

# Tools of the Trade

Role-playing games usually require very little aside from your imagination and a rulebook, but like any activity, there are some bits and pieces that you need. In this section, we are going to go over these tools, explain what they are for an whether they are optional or not.

## Rules

Almost all RPGs use a rulebook of some kind. After you have some experience with a game you will likely not need a rulebook to play your RPG of choice, but when you first start learning a game it is a good idea to have it nearby. This guide will go into more detail about which games and rulesets to start your RPG career off with later on, for now just assume that you will need a rulebook to play from.

Another thing worth mentioning about rulebooks is that they will also normally include a list of materials that you will need. Make sure to check this when you try a new game

## Dice

They come in all shapes, sizes, and colors; that's right, we're talking about dice. While some RPGs have eschewed our polyhedral friends in favor of cards, beads or no randomizer at all, most RPGs still use them.

### What are they used for?

RPGs most commonly use dice to generate a random number. This could be to determine whether William Tell skewers the apple, how far the ball is thrown, whether there really is a secret door behind the bookcase or any number of other things. Dice are also sometimes used as counters to track everything from time to physical health. In a pinch, dice can also be used as miniatures.

### How many do I need?

The number and type of dice that you will need varies from game to game. To get started it is best to have one complete set of dice. A complete set includes: a coin (d2), four-sided (d4), six-sided (d6), eight-sided (d8), ten-sided (d10), twelve-sided (d12), twenty-sided (d20), and a percentile (d%).

You may wish to have extra d6s and d10s as these are the two most commonly used dice.

There are some more esoteric varieties of dice out there, like the d30 or d1000. Such dice aren’t considered to be part of the basic “set” and are mostly used only for the sake of novelty. One unusual type of dice you may encounter are Fudge Dice. These are not novelty dice and have become increasingly common due to the success of the Fate RPG system. Fudge dice are written as dF. They appear as ordinary six-sided dice, but instead of numbers on the faces they have (+), (-) and blank faces.

## Character Sheets

A character sheet is a piece of paper or small booklet that you write down everything about your character into. Most role-playing books will contain a character sheet that you can photocopy and, in this digital age, all of the most forward-thinking publishers also post the official character sheets on their websites.

Your character sheet doesn't have to be anything so formal as a piece of paper with ‘character sheet’ scrawled across the top, though. A loose leaf piece of paper with the relevant information on it does the job just as well as a six-page character record book and index cards are easier to carry and look through. These days your smartphone or laptop might work best for you and, really, that is the most important thing.

## Miniatures

Very few games specifically call for the use of miniatures, but their use has gone hand in hand with role playing for many years. Figures have often been a popular way of representing your character in a number of different ways. Sometimes they are used much like game pieces and are moved around on a map or grid, other times they are used only as a kind of set piece. The important thing to keep in mind with minis is that they are not required. You can play almost every RPG without the use of one, although some groups may ask you to use something represent your character (a common proxy is a die or coin).

### Tokens

In the latest generation of role-playing games, tokens have become a popular alternative to miniatures. Tokens are round, flat cardboard pieces with artwork depicting a monster or hero on them. They come in a variety of sizes and are much easier to carry around. They are also significantly cheaper than metal or plastic miniatures. Some groups will use traditional miniatures for the heroes and tokens for monsters and NPCs.

## Pencil & Paper

There is a reason that tabletop role-playing games are sometimes called “pen and paper” games. It is because those two components are the single most important things to have, aside from the rules and people to play with. There are no particular requirements for your writing tool. Some people like ordinary yellow pencils, others like ink pens and still others like mechanical pencils. Use whatever you prefer, but do keep in mind that you will likely need to make many changes and that it is a good idea to use something that can be erased easily.

It is a similar story for paper. Most of the time just plain old scrap paper will be all you need. You may want to hang on to a proper character sheet, as described earlier, but it isn’t necessary. Different kinds of paper do have specific uses in role-playing games, though.

- **Blank** - Used for many things, but most commonly for sketching out pictures of things.
- **Lined** - Usually used notes, character history, and similar things.
- **Hex/Graph** - Used almost exclusively for mapping.
- **Index Cards** - Used to organize frequently used things, such as items or magic spells.

## Play Aids

There are a number of different aids used by role players, none of which are necessary to enjoy an RPG. Some of these are:

- Battlemats - used to map out dungeons and keep track of combats.
- Dungeon Tiles - as above, but with illustrated tiles instead of a reusable grid.
- Dice Towers and Bowls - keeps dice confined to a specific area.
- Calculators - may be used to track numbers that change frequently, such as HP.
- Computer Applications/Phone Apps - usage varies, commonly used to track aspects of the game or as a reference.
- GM Screen - a foldable screen designed to obscure the Guide’s notes and dice rolls.
- Mood Music/Sound Effects - usually handled by a computer application these days, but could be just as easily done with a CD, DVD or other kinds of media players.

## Costumes

Costume use is common in Live Action Role Playing (LARP). You should check the LARP guidelines on costumes or contact the organizer before finalizing your costume. There may be limits on the number and types of props as well as other factors, such as safety concerns and game lore.

Tabletop role-players do not typically play in costume, although it has been known to happen.

# Choosing Your First Game

Before you can get started with some actual role-playing you need to choose a game to enjoy. There are a lot of great games out there, but we suggest that you take a couple things into consideration:

- It is usually a good idea to pick a game that other people in your local community are already playing. This way you have people you can ask questions of as well as an existing pool of potential players for your game.
    
- Pick a genre that interests you. You can be surrounded by players enjoying Vampire: The Requiem, but if you aren't interested in a game about vampires then you probably won't enjoy it. If you plan on playing a variety of genres or just can't decide then perhaps a universal game would be a good choice for you.
    

## Themed vs. Universal

RPGs tend to fall into two different categories, those that have a specific setting and theme and those that are designed to work with any setting or theme. There is no right or wrong style, but each type has its advantages.

The great thing about universal games is that you can apply them to just about any setting you can think of. This means that you don't need to learn a new set of rules every time you want to switch things up. In addition to this, they may have an a la carte approach to rules that allows you to pick and choose which rules will work best for any specific game you wish to play. When you are first starting out a Universal RPG might seem like a lot chew over and in a way they are. These are big games with a lot of different rules and elements to take in. The key thing to keep in mind about them is that you do not--and probably should not--use all of the different rules presented. The reason these games have so many rules is so that you can play any kind of game with them. If the rules for firearms aren't going to come up in your game about cavemen then there is no need to learn them.

Themed games don’t have the breadth of universal games, but they do have a couple of things going for them. First, with a themed game, you have a built-in setting to work with. This puts less stress on the Guide to create a world to play in and can make the game easier for new players to get into. Second, these games are trying to create a specific style of play and may have features that just can’t be applied universally. For example, the magic system in Mistborn RPG seeks to recreate that of the novels by Brandon Sanderson. A universal RPG may not be capable of having such a specific touch.

For newcomers to the role-playing hobby, a themed RPG is often the best choice. They present a cohesive, and often simpler, set of rules. Their built-in setting and lore is a great way to start playing and get involved without feeling lost looking for the place to start. If you have a particular franchise that you love, such as Star Wars, you can start playing and already have a great idea about the kinds of things you can do by playing a Star Wars RPG. Whichever style of game you choose to start off with, I hope you try many varieties during your roleplaying career.

## A word on D&D

Dungeons & Dragons is the world’s best-known role-playing game. If you’re reading this guide there is a very good chance you came to find out how you could get started with D&D specifically. D&D can be a very good entry point to the RPG hobby. It is one of only a few RPGs with a professional quality beginner’s kit and it is probably the most widely played and best-supported role-playing game. We won’t be covering D&D specifically in this guide as it isn’t a free download, but of all of the advice contained within is applicable to D&D (as well as all other traditional RPGs).

## Our guide to chose your own game.

See our **[Game Recommendations](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/gamerec)** for a comprehensive guide to pick a game system for you.

See also the [**Solo** / **Single Player Gaming**](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/solo)

## Suggested Free RPGs

There are thousands of different tabletop RPGs out there. 3426 different RPGs are recorded in the RPG Geek database at the time of writing this. As you can imagine, that is far more than we could hope to cover in any guide. For this reason, we have selected a few our favorite games that are both free to download and beginner friendly in our [Free RPGs Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/freerpgs).

## Beginner Kits

In this section, you will find a number of games that, while not free, come with everything you need to start playing. They are complete packages that come with various rules and accessories you need to play. They are also designed as entry-level products and are written in such a way as to be friendly and easy to use for beginners to the RPG hobby.

#### D&D 5e Starter Set

D&D is a game of epic high fantasy where players take on the roles of mighty heroes as the crawl through dungeons, save the world and, yes, even slay dragons.

The fifth edition of Dungeons & Dragons is the most recent version of the game available at the time of writing this and the D&D Starter Box is an entry-level D&D product which contains everything you need to start playing the latest iteration of the classic game. The rules are simplified and feature a step by step adventure to play through. While these simplified rules are great for beginners, at some point players will want to graduate to full-fledged game. The good news is that all of the basic rules for D&D 5e have been published digitally for free.

D&D is one of the largest, if not the largest, and best-supported RPGs available. It has a presence at most hobby conventions as well as programs geared towards new players, such as D&D Encounters. The Starter Set is a great starting point for any fledgling player.

#### Pathfinder Beginner Box

Golarion is a high fantasy world filled with gnomes, elves, dwarves and all manner of other fantastic races. With the Pathfinder RPG, a player can jump in ready to craft their own epic adventures or join the famed Pathfinder Society, a group of covert agents and adventurers, to further the goals of Inner Sea factions.

Pathfinder rivals D&D 5e in the number of players that enjoy it regularly. Its roots lie in the previous edition of D&D and it maintains a similar playstyle. Much like D&D, Pathfinder enjoys a lively and widespread community with plenty of organized events to attend.

The Beginner Box is a simplified ruleset that, like The Red Box, provides an excellent introduction to the hobby. It contains everything that you need to play and a little bit more. You should be aware that The Beginner Box is an introductory product and does not contain the complete rules. Players that enjoy the game will need to upgrade to the core rulebook at some point. That aside, it is a much more friendly and affordable introduction than the core rulebook is.

One very nice thing about Pathfinder is that many of the rules and content are published under an open license and available for free in a wiki format. This makes it very easy and inexpensive to graduate into the full Pathfinder RPG once you exhaust the beginner box.

#### Mouse Guard Box Set

The Mouse Guard RPG is set in the world created by David Petersen in his Eisner Award-winning comic book series. It features a world inhabited by sentient mice. Players in the Mouse Guard RPG take on the role of mice that belong to the Mouse Guard, a group that helps other mice survive the wilderness and fend off predators.

Mouse Guard is suitable for all ages, although parents should be aware that the world of Mouse Guard is not as friendly and cuddly as the premise would lead you to believe. The game is easy to learn, clearly written, and has even won an Award for its design. The art, taken from the comic series, is also splendid. The box set comes with everything you need to play, including the rules, adventures, dice, cards and even a map.

#### Cyberpunk Red Jumpstart Kit

The tabletop prequel to CD Projekt RED's Cyberpunk 2077, Cyberpunk Red is a punk game of hackers, cybernetics, corporate warfare, and urban sprawl. Available as both a PDF and (eventually) a physical boxed set, the Jumpstart kit contains everything needed to begin playing in the dark future:

- A 44 page starter rules book
- A 50 page primer on the setting, including one starter adventure and three one-page adventures
- Six pre-generated characters
- Printable/Cardboard character standees

#### Traveller Starter Box

The original science fiction roleplaying game, Traveller is a hard science fiction game focused around sandbox gaming in a massive galaxy. A typical Traveller campaign features players who own the mortgage on a small merchant frigate, moving cargo from point A to point B and doing odd jobs that may or may not be legal.

The Starter Set features all the rules included in the Core Rulebook, The Fall of Tinath adventure, and various maps.

#### Starfinder Beginner Box

Set in the very distant future of the Pathfinder RPG, Starfinder is a space fantasy game of lasers, spaceships, alien worlds, and magic.

The Beginner Box includes everything you need to get started:

- 96 page booklet for players containing character creation rules and a solo adventure
- 96 page booklet for the Game Master containing an adventure, alien NPCs, and advice on running the game
- A complete set of 7 dice needed to play

#### Doctor Who: Adventures in Time & Space Box Set

The beloved British television show, Doctor Who, has introduced multiple generations to science fiction. The latest RPG based on it is Doctor Who:AiT&S and has one of the best introductory box sets available in the hobby. While the game is named after the eponymous and titular hero, the rules do not require his presence. They are written and presented in such a way that any group of heroes can blunder their way through space or time, with or without The Doctor.

Doctor Who comes with the complete rulebook, which is written in a casual and concise way and features a simple, yet flexible, set of rules. The box set contains everything that you will ever need to play the game, but the crown jewel is a set of introductory adventures with step by step advice for first time Guides. Even better, the adventure booklet also contains numerous adventure “seeds” to get a fledgling Guide started on creating their own adventures. The rules also de-emphasize violence as a solution to problems and instead encourages negotiation and wits.

#### Call of Cthulhu Starter Set

A Lovecraftian game of mystery, horror, and various untimely (but inevitable) deaths, Call of Cthulhu is one of the oldest horror games. Based on the works of H.P. Lovecraft, Call of Cthulhu entices players to investigate horrific happenings, face incomprehensible cosmic beings, and sustain sanity.

The Starter Set comes with everything you need to start playing:

- Introductory solo adventure Alone Against the Flames that teaches the rules via a choose-your-own-adventure style mystery
- Basic rules for character creation and playing the game
- Three starter adventures with various handouts to give to your players as they uncover the various mysteries
- Pre-generated Investigator sheets, in addition to blank Investigator sheets
- Set of six dice needed to play the game

# Finding Your Local Community

If you are diving into RPGs on your own, then one of the very first things you will need to do is find some people to play with. Assuming that nobody in your current circle of friends and family is interested, your next stop should be your local RPG community. In this section, we are going to cover the various ways you can get in touch with this seemingly elusive social group.

## Find Your FLGS

An FLGS is a Friendly Local Game Store. These are often the hub of your local gaming community. FLGS are usually involved with the local community and can point you to events or may even run events themselves. These stores may even have a message board to help you find local players.

If your city or town has one of these magical places you have probably already seen it. They tend to have posters in the windows advertising all manner of different games and may have tables set up inside for people like you to enjoy a few games at.

If you haven’t yet found your FLGS then you have a few places to check, such as:

- [Friendly Local Game Stores (FLGS) of the USA](https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Friendly_Local_Game_Stores_%28FLGS%29_of_the_USA)
- [boardgaming.com/localstores](https://boardgaming.com/localstores)
- [localgamestores.com](https://www.localgamestores.com/)

## Web Services

In this digital age, you can almost always turn to the Internet to help you find things. Finding role players is no different. There are a number of ways to find gamers online, but we’re only going to cover a few of them here.

Our [Playing Online](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/rpgonline)-guide has a [LFG websites](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/rpgonline#wiki_websites)-section.

### Meetup

[Meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/topics/tabletop-role-playing-and-board-games/) is a great way to find local role-playing groups in your city. Simply go to the website and try searching using keywords such as role-playing, RPG, or the name of the game you want to play.

### Player Registries/Networks

This is a catch-all term that applies to online services that list players. [Pen & Paper Games](http://www.penandpapergames.com) and [The Gauntlet](https://www.gauntlet-rpg.com/) are two options. [StartPlaying.games](https://startplaying.games/) is a platform for finding paid games.

### [/r/LFG](/r/LFG)

Since this guide does originate from the [/r/RPG](/r/RPG), it would be remiss not to mention the [Looking For Group subreddit](/r/LFG). Here you will find people posting games that need players or players looking for others nearby. If you want to play with other Redditors then this is the place to go. Other LFG subs:

- [/r/LFG_Europe](/r/LFG_Europe) - Easier to find European players on an appropriate timezone
- [/r/Roll20LFG](/r/Roll20LFG) - LFG sub for the [/r/Roll20](/r/Roll20) VTT platform
- [/r/LFGPremium](/r/LFGPremium) - LFG sub for Pay-to-Play games
- [/r/lfgmisc](/r/lfgmisc) - LFG sub for games other than D&D5E & Pathfinder

### Universities/Colleges/Community Centers

If you have a university or college near to you then it is a good bet there is a club associated with it. A little research may reveal a Fantasy/SF club or--if you are especially lucky-- a board game, war gaming, or role-playing games club. These clubs are an excellent starting point for finding players.

You may find that your local recreation or community center also has a similar club, but it is less common than at a university/college.

### Organized Play

Did you know that some of the larger game companies have officially organized play events? There are also some unofficial organized play societies surrounding popular games. Either way, these can be the perfect venue to meet other players or try out a game.

- Living Forgotten Realms
    
- Pathfinder Society
    
- D&D Encounters
    
- Lair Assault
    
- Mind's Eye Society
    
- ConstantCon
    

### Conventions

Conventions have long been a way for people sharing a common interest of skillset to get together and share what they know. The role-playing community is no different. Every year there are conventions across the world where gamers meet, play some games with each other and generally have a great time.

These conventions are often paired with science fiction, fantasy, anime, comic book, and video game conventions. Do not be alarmed if this is the case for your local convention, just look at your convention map and find out where they have placed the game tables.

## [Role Playing Online](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/rpgonline)

Sitting around a table with good friends is the traditional way of playing tabletop RPGs, but what if not everyone can get to the table? Maybe you live in a remote area and there aren’t a lot of options or maybe you want to get together with your old group and everyone is separated by oceans. Don’t worry, we have the world’s most efficient communications tool at our disposal: the Internet.

[Role Playing Online](https://www.reddit.com/r/rpg/wiki/rpgonline) now has its own wiki page.

# Gaming Etiquette

Like any other social activity, gaming has some unwritten rules that you should follow for a smooth and friendly experience. In this section, we’ll cover some of these so that you have an understanding of how to behave in certain situations.

We will only cover etiquette that is specifically about gaming here. Please refer to your regional/cultural etiquette for how to behave as a guest in someone’s home and so on.

### Location-specific Etiquette

#### When gaming at a game store (FLGS) you should:

- Be mindful of those playing nearby. Try not to disturb other groups or games with loud noises or rowdy activity. Use family-friendly language as there may be children or customers present.
    
- Do not bring food or drink inside the store without the express permission of the proprietor.
    
- Do not play games that are not sold at the store.
    
- Make an effort to buy books and accessories from the store, especially if you regularly play there.
    

#### When gaming at a cafe, diner or similar location:

- Ask the proprietor if it okay to play there.
    
- Play at off-peak times or leave the table if normal customers need it.
    
- Purchase food/drink from the store.
    
- Do not bring your own food and/or refreshments.
    
- Tip the waiter/barista/etc. well.
    

#### When gaming at a convention you should:

- Get up from your seat if you are not playing. This goes double for elimination games.
    
- Avoid signing up for more than one game per slot or for games you do not think you will attend.
    

#### When gaming at a private residence you should:

- Observe the cultural etiquette required of a guest in another person’s home.
    
- Never bring along an unexpected guest without discussing with the Host.
    

### Food & Drink

- Always check with the Host before bringing food or drink.
    
- Before bringing/partaking in alcohol (or another inebriant) clear it with your group.
    
- Traditionally the Guide should/does not pay for their food or drink. If the Host is a different person from the Guide then the same goes for them. This is a way of thanking the Guide/Host for organizing and planning the game/providing a place to play.
    

### Players & Organization

- If you can’t make a game or will be late you should let your Guide know at the earliest possible opportunity.
    
- Do not bring a new player without discussing it with the Guide first. If playing at someone’s private residence then you should discuss it with the Host as well.
    
- If a single player owns the books/equipment used to play the game it is customary for the group to gift them a new book from time to time as a way of saying thank you.
    

### While Playing

- Try not to interrupt other players.
    
- Try not to raise a complaint/issue with rules during play. Wait for a break or for the game to end.
    
- Never assume control of another player’s character without their permission.
    
- Do not try and play someone's character for them.
    
- Do not touch another player’s dice, miniature or character sheet without their permission.
    
- Avoid starting off-topic conversations with other players while you await your turn.
    
- Do not leave the table for another activity such as video gaming, watching television or table tennis during play.
    

### When Playing Online

- Check the community rules. There are usually very good guidelines posted.
    
- Do not start off-topic/out of character conversations within the thread/chat of the game. Use a separate thread/channel/window.
    
- Be punctual. Be online at the scheduled time for real-time games and maintain your update frequency for asynchronous games (usually at least 1 update per week).
    
- Never assume control of another player’s character or write them into your action (especially negatively) without their permission.
    

# Player 101

In this section, we will cover the basics of playing an RPG. We provide some tips for making characters to roleplay with as well as cover the traditional structure of tabletop role-playing games.

### Your First Character

The first step required of any RPG is that of making a character. This can be a very overwhelming task, but it is also very rewarding. We won’t be covering specifics in this section--every game does character creation a little bit differently. What we will do is offer you some tips on how to actually come up with a character to play as and how to get into the role.

#### Concept

One of the most difficult things about making a new character is coming up with the overall concept. It’s a very simple thing to say, “Make a character.” and quite another to come up with a character that you want to make. Here are some tips for getting over that initial hump.

- **Steal from fiction.** There is absolutely nothing wrong with re-creating a character you like from fiction. You can even steal from reality. If you want to make a character inspired by Captain Ahab then you do just that. Do try and make the character your own, though. What if Captain Ahab was an Orc Barbarian from the plains? Maybe his white whale would be a white rhino.
    
- **Play an Archetype.** If you can’t think of a specific character then you can always play an archetype. If you think it might be fun to play a sneaky thief or an anarchist hacker then you can just write that down and build up the personality over time.
    
- **Play a sample character.** Most RPGs come with a number of pre-built characters. Why not select one to play with? Over time they will grow into a unique character based on how you play them.
    
- **Play yourself.** An often overlooked option is to just play yourself. If you play yourself you have no need to “get into the head” of the character, you’re already there! Why not imagine yourself in the setting of the game? What would you be like as a wizard or space pirate?
    

#### Execution

The hardest part of character creation is really coming up with the concept. Once you have that it is just a matter of following the rules to make the character for the game. For a new player, this might be a small hurdle. Here are some tips to help you jump over that hurdle.

- **Ask the other players for help.** Some of them might be veteran players that know the rules inside and out. Even if there are no veterans a second set of eyes can really help with figuring out the rules. Your Guide, at the very least, should have a basic understanding of how to build a character.
    
- **Look over the character sheet.** You can learn a lot from a game’s character sheet. Take a look at what sections need to be filled out and then look them up in the rules. Sometimes it’s easier to work on something in small pieces.
    
- **Look at the sample characters** and see how they fit together. Consider using one as the basis of your own character.
    
- **Check the game’s official website and forums.** The chances are that if you are stuck on something someone else has been in the past.
    
- **Ask for help on an RPG message board**, like rpg.stackexchange.com.
    

## Playing an RPG

You have a character made and a group to play with, what now? While the answer to this question does vary from game to game, we can cover the basic structure that makes up a role-playing game.

### The Basic Structure

**Scene is Set**

The very first step in any traditional role-playing game is for the Guide to set the scene. They will describe where your character is, what they can see and hear, what other characters are doing and everything else that might be important. The Guide might prompt the players to answer questions about their characters, describe what they are doing and so on.

**Players Ask Questions**

Once the scene has been set it is time for the players to ask any questions they might have. Perhaps you want to know if there is anything else you can see or what the door is made out of. The Guide will answer your questions and often these questions will lead into the next phase.

**Players Declare Actions**

When the players are ready they declare what they want their character to do. Often this will be a result of the previous questions. A player may wish to have their character investigate a cabinet, cast a spell, chase after someone or any number of other things. What a character can do is limited only by imagination and the rules of the games universe. The Guide may ask players to roll dice to see if their characters are successful at what they are doing.

**Guide Narrates Reactions**

After a player has declared what they want their character to do the Guide must respond. It is the Guide’s job to tell everyone what happens. Does the door break open? Do they catch the fleeing criminal? The Guide should describe in enough detail to paint an interesting narrative, but not so much that they slow down the game. Some Guides and games will encourage players to contribute to the narration and it’s always encouraged to be descriptive when declaring actions.

**Repeat**

The players and Guide repeat these phases as needed. This back and forth between players and Guide makes up the core structure of most traditional role-playing games. Of course, this structure can vary from game to game so it is always a good idea to see what the rulebook says.
