# Lomads Proof of Contribution Protocol


@naman negi this is just an outline. can you please develop it into first version by adding details and editing and reorganising it?

Welcome to Lomads Proof of Contribution Protocol

Embark on a transformative journey with the Lomads Proof of Contribution Protocol, a decentralized system spotlighting the essence of individual contributions through the innovative Soulbound Token (SBT).

1. Overview: The protocol encapsulates a person's digital journey, from personal milestones to collaborative efforts, using advanced cryptographic measures, ensuring a secure and transparent framework.

Lomads' Offerings:

Attribute-rich Tokens: Lomads is not just another reputation system; it's a detailed digital diary showcasing a person's entire digital expedition.

Decentralized Contribution Capture: With open architecture, developers are free to craft DApps, capturing everything from event attendance to open-source engagement.

Tailored Query Applications: Extract valuable insights from stored data, aiding in everything from candidate sourcing to incentive automation.

Empowered Organizational Control: Customize what you wish to capture, making the SBT narrative truly yours.

2. Metadata & Contribution Tracking:

Metadata functions as a core component to document a contributor's activities and inputs in the organization. This includes completed tasks, collaborated projects, acquired skills, and other pertinent data points. Through this, the organization gains a comprehensive perspective on individual contributors.

3. Role Assignment & Access Control:

Role designation derives its basis from the metadata and the contribution history of individuals. These roles mirror the trust quotient, capabilities, and duties vested upon a contributor. The resultant roles then dictate access levels. For instance, while a seasoned contributor might access critical fiscal details, a newbie may be limited to specific software utilities. This system not only reinforces security but also promotes effective resource utilization.

4. Developer & Collaborator Network:

Capture DApps: These tools, tailored by developers, record and validate users' contributions across a plethora of platforms.

Query DApps: Designed for in-depth analysis, these DApps decode stored attributes to facilitate decisions.

Collaborative Development: The ethos of open-source collaboration invites developers to enhance, adapt, or even create new branches from the existing DApps to cater to niche requirements.

5. Termination & Exit Protocols:

Termination Process: To maintain a secured environment, once a contributor departs, their Soulbound Token undergoes revocation, effectively nullifying associated access rights. Admins can oversee and initiate this.

Issue an Exit SBT: An Exit Soulbound Token comes into play post-departure, encompassing various metadata elements like access history, undertaken projects, departure rationale, and the official exit date.

Exit Documentation: This entails a meticulous record-keeping process, chronicling token revocation specifics like timestamp, individual's wallet details, contract coordinates of the nullified token, and the Exit SBT.

6. Cryptographic Security:

Identity Verification: Ensure participant authenticity when managing attributes.

Data Encryption: Securely encrypt captured attributes, making them accessible only to authorized entities.

Immutable Ledger: The blockchain ensures that once an attribute is verified and added, its integrity is preserved.

7. Community Engagement & Governance:

Feedback Mechanism: Encourage active community input for refinements.

Protocol Upgrades: Stay updated through enhancements driven by community consensus.

Collaborative Decision-Making: A decentralized governance system allows all stakeholders to influence the protocol's direction.

8. Organizational Participation:

Custom Integration: Integrate seamlessly, using third-party DApps or crafting bespoke ones to match organizational needs.

Configurable Rules: Prioritize specific contributions, resonating with the organization's ethos.

In essence, the Lomads Proof of Contribution Protocol signifies the evolution from centralized to community-driven models in the crypto era, championing the narratives of individuals. As we redefine individual and organizational security and reputation in the digital age, Lomads ensures that every step, every contribution, and every individual finds its rightful place in the vast decentralized canvas.
