# How to Use Friend.tech and the Friend.tech Airdrop

5.0 | by [Joel Agbo](/author/joelagbo) Updated August 24 2023

![How to use friend.tech](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7814/content_How_to_use_friend.tech.webp)

## How to Get Started With Friend.tech

You'll need a mobile phone, a Twitter (X) account, a friend.tech invite code and at least 0.01 ETH to fund your friend.tech account.

---

### Key Takeaways

- Friend.tech is a decentralized social media application on the Base network. Users own personalized shares and purchase other users’ shares to be able to interact with the shareowners.
    
- Friend.tech also has a dedicated airdrop tab where points are allocated weekly on Friday. These points are expected to translate to tokens for friend.tech governance. 
    

---

Cryptocurrency enthusiasts are raving about [friend.tech](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/friend-tech-social-app-base), the new social media application on the [Base](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/base-coinbase-layer-2) network. Over 111,000 users have bought account shares on the application and moved over 45,000 ETH while creating accounts and trading user shares on the platform based on data from [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/cryptokoryo/friendtech).

![Friend.tech dune analytics data](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7804/content_Dune_analytics.webp)

You can also [track friend.tech shares on Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/friend-tech).

Friend.tech tokenizes user influence and attention and lets other users purchase rights to a creator’s attention. Creators and influential individuals can utilize the application to connect to their audience, where shareholders enjoy privileges like being able to enter private chatrooms with the creator or user.. It also presents them an opportunity to monetize their influence, where user shares (known as keys on the platform) are tradable. These key prices are based on supply and demand, with the keys currently going for up to 2.65 ETH for Racer, one of friend.tech's founders. 

At time of writing, the application is still in its beta testing phase, and new users will need to obtain an invite code to be able to access the application.

Ready to try the application? Follow this guide to get started,

## Download the Application

Friend.tech is a PWA (Progressive Web Application), which can be installed in your device like a native mobile application. However, PWAs aren't limited to specific operating systems as they are enabled by the web browser.

To download friend.tech:

1. Visit Friend.tech on your mobile device
    
2. Click on the menu on the top right corner of your browser and select **Install app**. Allow the download to complete.
    

![Install friend.tech ](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7805/content_Install_friend.tech.webp)

You can now access the platform by tapping on the friend.tech icon from your application list.  

## Create a Friend.tech Account

Now that you've downloaded the application, it's time to create your account.

### Step 1: Create an Account 

Click **Sign in** to start your account creation process. In the next screen, enter your mobile number or use your Google or Apple account to sign up.

![Create friend.tech account ](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7806/content_Create_friend.tech_account.webp)

### Step 2: Find a Friend.tech Invite Code

Friend.tech is an invite-only application at the moment, so you'll need an invite code in order to use the application. You can obtain an invite code from friends who are already using the application. You can also look out for users sharing access codes on Twitter or other social media channels. 

![Find an Access Code](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7808/content_Find_an_Access_Code.webp)

Once you obtain an access code, enter the access code in the provided box and click **Proceed**.

### Step 3: Link Your Twitter

Friend.tech requires you to connect to your Twitter account. You will need to authorize the application to access your Twitter profile in order to user friend.tech.

![Link socials to friend.tech](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7812/content_Link_Socials_%281%29.webp)

### Step 4: Fund Your Friend.tech Account

There are two ways to fund your account: you can either deposit ETH directly into your friend.tech wallet through the Ethereum mainnet, or send ETH to the provided address on the Base network. In the case of the latter, ensure that you are sending via the Base network or your funds might get lost. Do note that the minimum deposit is 0.01 ETH.

When this is done, you can now start trading shares on the platform. 

![Fund your friend.tech account](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7810/content_Fund_your_friend.tech_account.webp)

## How To Trade Keys On Friend.tech

Now that your account is funded, it's time to buy your first shares! 

![Buy your first friend.tech key](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7811/content_Buy_your_first_friend.tech_key.webp)You can also purchase other users' keys on the platform. If you have a specific Twitter (X) account you'd like to connect with, you can search for their username under the Explore tab. Under the Explore tab you'll also be able to see the top users, as well as who's trending at the moment. 

![Explore tab friend.tech](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/how-to-use-friend-tech//s3.amazonaws.com/assets.coingecko.com/coingecko/public/ckeditor_assets/pictures/7813/content_Explore_tab_friend.tech.webp)

Once you purchase a user’s shares, you can message them from your Chats tab.

## Friend.tech Airdrop

Under the friend.tech **Airdrop** tab, users can see how many points they've earned over the course of the week. Points are allocated based on the user's activites on the platform, and are calculated on a weekly basis.

The current sentiment is that these points will likely translate to a future token, as the Series A round came with token warrants.

To accumulate points, users can trade creators to build up their aggregate transaction volume. It's also likely that the more popular an account is, the more points the creator will earn. As an example, Cobie, who's one of the top five accounts on friend.tech at time of writing, earned [1.1million points](https://twitter.com/milesdeutscher/status/1693374208196350355/photo/1) in the first drop.

Do note that airdrops are highly speculative and following the above steps is not guaranteed to result in earning tokens. 

## Final Thoughts

Friend.tech holds many promises, and a significant number of cryptocurrency enthusiasts are exploring these opportunities. If you are looking to get started, this guide takes you through the basic procedures. It is, however, not exhaustive of the operations on the platform. As the platform develops, new features are likely to be added. Ensure that you understand how these features work and how they apply to users.
