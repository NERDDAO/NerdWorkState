scientists worldwide and get inspired like never before.

Aspiring researchers, scientists, technicians and visionaries often must put their passions on ice in order to jump through hoops held up by instituions and traditions. Here though, all ideas are valid and anyone, anywhere can see their dreams realised. DeScientists are in the business of defeating gatekeepers and inspiring innovation.

Research; unrestricted, unbiased, uncensorable.

Science

as it should be.

Science has become a monolithic institution: an altar at which modern society offers its brightest and best; at which world governments, NGOs and HNWIs lay uncountable tithe; where we place our faith to solve pressing global issues. To prevent capture, it is essential that we decentralise these institutions and maintain transparency and accountability.
