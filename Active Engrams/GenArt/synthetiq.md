The group of artists known as Abstract Expressionists emerged in the United States in the years following World War II. The subject of their works was not "abstract" but rather primal images rooted in the collective unconscious. The Abstract Expressionists' work did not express emotion but communicated universal truths about the human condition. Five aspects of their distinctive aesthetic include:

1. Non-Objective Imagery: Rather than depict the world around them, Abstract Expressionists focused on creating expressions of their internal experiences and emotions.

2. Emotional Intensity: The paintings from this movement seem emotionally charged and convey a sense of personal meaning. They often exhibit a high level of intensity and drama.

3. Large Scale: Most Abstract Expressionist paintings are large in scale, a characteristic that allows the viewer to feel engulfed by the artwork. This size also helps to intensify the emotional impact of these paintings. 

4. Visible Signs of the Artist’s Working Process: Signs of the artist’s process, such as brush strokes and texture, are often evident in Abstract Expressionist works.

5. Lack of clear focal point: The paintings rarely have one clear point of focus. Instead, they invite the viewer's gaze to wander over the surface of the painting, engaging with its forms and textures.

Given the atrocities of World War II, Existentialism appealed to the Abstract Expressionists. The artist’s physical struggle with his materials suggests that a painting might serve as a lasting mark of one's existence. The Abstract Expressionist movement is closely linked with painting but also informed the sculpture of David Smith and Aaron Siskind’s photography.

Various styles emerged within this movement, such as the "Action Painting" style associated with Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock, and Franz Kline and the "Color Field" style exemplified by Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman. Abstract Expressionism’s legacy has significantly influenced artists in the US and around the world, with its style reflecting American democracy, individualism, and cultural achievement.
