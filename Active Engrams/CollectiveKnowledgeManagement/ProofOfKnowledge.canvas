Notably, validation systems are often centralized, limiting accessibility and increasing the potential for bias or censorship. In such systems, valuable contributions of knowledge may go unrewarded or under-acknowledged, inhibiting motivation for the sharing of unique insights and deterring the growth of collective knowledge resources.\n\nThe Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol, leveraged within the DeSciWorld ecosystem, is devised to fundamentally address these issues. Our innovative, blockchain-based mechanism serves to incentivize and reward knowledge contributions in a decentralized, transparent, and equitable manner. The protocol establishes a new paradigm that ensures constant incentive, instills fairness, and enhances the availability and quality of shared knowledge.\n\nThis document delves into the workflow of the Proof of Knowledge protocol - the submission of knowledge, the validation process, the assignment of value, and how user interaction metrics influence the dynamism of valuations. It outlines the robust system put forward for catalyzing knowledge sharing and frameworks rewarding individuals for their intellectual contributions, fostering a thriving space for continual learning and knowledge exchange.","x":4719,"y":2053,"width":645,"height":770,"color":"6"},

The PoK mechanism rewards individuals for their valuable contributions of knowledge via a blockchain-based platform, allowing for seamless recognition, validation, and dedication of rewards. \n\n### 1. Workflow of the PoK Mechanism\n\nThe Proof of Knowledge mechanism within DeSciWorld involves two fundamental steps: Knowledge (Engram) Submission and Knowledge Validation & Value Attribution.\n\n#### 1.1. Knowledge Submission\n\nParticipants, referred to as \"Nerds,\" commence by submitting units of knowledge, termed \"Study Questions (SQ).\" An SQ is a distinct, indivisible knowledge unit accompanied by a set of attributes: \n\n- **Question Text/Data:** This encompasses the essential content of the query.\n- **Metadata:** This provides additional information about the SQ, such as the subject matter, authorship details, complexity level, among others.\n- **Unique SQ ID:** A distinctive identifier for the Study Question.\n\nEach SQ is registered on the DeSciWorld Blockchain, safeguarding its timestamp and authorship details. When a new SQ is submitted, it is stamped with a freshly minted Non-Fungible Token (NFT), symbolizing the unique identity and ownership of the question.\n\n#### 1.2. Knowledge Validation & Value Attribution\n\nOnce a Study Question is submitted and stored on-chain, it undergoes a validation process by Validators across the DeSciWorld network. Validators are responsible for assessing the accuracy, clarity, relevance, and novelty of each SQ. Their validation scores affect the preliminary value assigned to the question. \n\nThe value of an SQ is dynamic and may increase based on usage metrics ascertained through the advanced AI-based search system. Popular SQs that gain attention (via views, shares, upvotes, or significant references in fresh discoveries) accumulate more value over time.\n\nThe SQ's value is linked to its network usage. Usage initiates a royalty mechanism that compensates the SQ's author/owner with DST tokens, fostering a conducive environment for constant learning and collaborative knowledge exchange. \n\n### 2. The Role of the Search System and User Metrics \n\nAn integral part of DeSciWorld's PoK mechanism is the advanced AI-based search system. The search system is used by Nerds to locate specific Engrams or Study Questions. Each substantial interaction with an Engram or SQ sends usage data to the PoK mechanism. \n\nUser interactions can range from the frequency of appearances of an SQ in search results, the frequency of its selection from the results, the number of direct or indirect references made to it in new SQs, and assessments of how helpful the SQ was to a user's research or learning process. \n\nThe system measures these interactions and, based on that, adjusts the value of each Engram or SQ. The more an Engram is recognized as beneficial or pivotal to ongoing research or learning, the more value it gains in the system, and the greater rewards are distributed to the Nerd who contributed it.\n\n### 3. Conclusion\n\nThe Proof-of-Knowledge mechanism as part of the DeSciWorld ecosystem uses blockchain technology for incentivizing contributions and verifying the accuracy and relevance of knowledge within the network. It offers a dynamic and adaptable system that caters to the varying needs and interests of users while continually encouraging a superior standard of shared knowledge.","x":4672,"y":319,"width":1104,"height":1367,"color":"6"},

It's a piece of information that is interconnected within a broader landscape of data, contributing to the broader understanding of a concept or topic.\n\n## Components of an Engram\n\nAn Engram consists of several integral components that collectively contribute to its formation and execution:\n\n1. **Data:** This is the base content of the Engram, formulated into a structured unit of knowledge or a discrete package of information. \n   \n2. **Metadata:** The Metadata provides critical information about the data in the Engram itself. It lends context and understanding about the contained knowledge, bolstering its relevance within the Knowledge Graph.\n\n3. **Unique Identifier:** Every Engram has a unique ID associated with it, allowing for its distinct recognition, tracking, and management within the overall Knowledge Graph system.\n\n4. **Relationships:** These are connections that an Engram has with other relevant Engrams in the Knowledge Graph. These relationships can be thought of as edges in the graph, defining how pieces of information are interconnected, and enabling the creation of a comprehensive, multi-dimensional structure of knowledge. \n\n5. **Context:** The framework or situation in which the Engram knowledge is applicable. The context helps in understanding how and where the information might be relevant, beneficial, or useful.\n\n## Validation of Engrams\n\nThe validation process of individual Engrams happens continually throughout the lifecycle of its usage by a global network of AI interfaces. This mechanism operates as a form of a market, where the relevance, accuracy, and usefulness of an Engram's information are tested and reaffirmed through its active usage and demand.\n\nAI interfaces, when querying a database or Knowledge Graph, will interact with and select Engrams based on their relevance and usefulness to the query or task at hand. These traces and records of interaction and usage then form a part of the 'lifecycle' of the Engram. Over time, Engrams that repeatedly prove to be beneficial and relevant will garner higher validation scores through their usage statistics.\n\nThis method of validation leverages the dynamic and iterative abilities of AI - factoring in the frequency, nature, and context of an Engram's usage - to ascertain its value and authenticity within the Knowledge Graph. It serves to maintain the quality, relevance, and value of information in the Knowledge Graph, ensuring that the Engrams reflect validated, useful, and reliable units of knowledge.","x":6416,"y":-153,"width":1292,"height":1052,"color":"6"},

It is essential for delivering a seamless narrative that not only makes sense but also accurately and efficiently serves to answer queries generated within the system.\n\nHuman operators play a pivotal role in maintaining and ensuring coherence within engrams. They design, monitor, and adjust the processes of engram creation and structuring, thereby ensuring that individual pieces of information are logically and correctly linked together. They act as the quality control mechanism to ensure there is no dissonance within the knowledge nodes and that each engram maintains structural and informational integrity. \n\nHuman operators also refine the accuracy and relevance of the information within engrams, periodically updating and revising the information as necessary. They are also responsible for analyzing coherence metric outcomes, making decisions to restructure or revise engrams whenever necessary to optimize coherence.\n\n# Local to Global Coherence\n\nLocal coherence refers to the immediate relationships and connections within singular engrams, while global coherence extends to the broader context of the Knowledge Graph, considering the relationships and interconnections between multiple engrams.\n\nThe extrapolation of local coherence to globally coherent embedding spaces is a critical aspect of Knowledge Graph development. It ensures that the entire structure of interconnected knowledge is logical, consistent, and cohesive, thereby maximizing the usefulness and reliability of the Knowledge Graph as a whole.\n\nWhen local coherence is maintained within each engram, and these coherently structured engrams are interconnected, it leads to the creation of a globally coherent embedding space. \n\nThis global coherence is fundamental for the effective functioning of AI in deriving meaningful insights and responses from the Knowledge Graph. A globally coherent Space allows for efficient navigation through the Knowledge Graph, easier identification of relevant engrams, and more accurate responses to queries or tasks. \n\nIn a nutshell, coherence is fundamental, shaping the value of Knowledge Engrams, and ultimately, informing the efficacy and accuracy of a Knowledge Graph. By prioritizing coherence via engram structuring and human operator guidance, one can facilitate accurate, meaningful, and useful exchanges of information within this system.","x":6618,"y":1102,"width":1337,"height":1018,"color":"6"},

Each contribution and intellectual input is validated and logged in the blockchain, establishing a transparent trail for reward allocation. It eliminates the possibility of unscrupulous behaviour and ensures that all rewarded entities are correctly and duly remunerated for their contributions.\n\nThus, the use of Ethereum attestation in the proposed architecture solves a critical challenge, providing a secure, distributed, and credible way to validate and incentivize knowledge contributions.

Here's how you can technically use EAS to generate PoK.\n\n#### 1. Defining the Attestation Schema\n\nFirst, an appropriate attestation schema has to be defined to structure the knowledge proofs. This schema can contain data fields related to the specific knowledge domain, including identifiers of the knowledge author, engram details, validation, and usage data. \n\nIn smart contracts, schemas are registered through `function registerSchema(string memory _schemaName, address _owner, address _resolver, string memory _schemaJson)`). \n\nThe schema json (_schemaJson) in this case should be designed to cater to the expected structure of the Proof of Knowledge. \n\nFor example:\n```json\n{\n    \"title\": \"Engram Proof\",\n    \"type\": \"object\",\n    \"properties\": {\n        \"engramTitle\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Title of the engram.\"\n        },\n        \"author\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Identifier of the author.\"\n        },\n        \"validator\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Identifier of the validator.\"\n        },\n        \"usageData\": {\n            \"type\": \"string\",\n            \"description\": \"Usage data of the engram.\"\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n#### 2. Attesting to Knowledge \n\nOnce the schema is registered, an entity (say, a knowledge author) can provide a proof of knowledge by making an attestation using the defined schema. \n\nIn smart contracts, an attestation is made using the `function attest(bytes32 _schemaId, address _subject, bytes memory _data, bool _isPrivate, bool _isHeld)`.\n\nHere:\n\n- _schemaId: The ID of the registered schema.\n- _subject: The entity to which the attestation applies - the engram identifier in this case.\n- _data: The proof of knowledge information according to the schema (data including knowledge details, validation details, etc.)\n- _isPrivate: Indicates if the attestation is private.\n- _isHeld: Whether the attestation is held by the subject (engram owner) directly.\n\n#### 3. Verifying Knowledge Proof \n\nAnyone wishing to verify the proof of knowledge could do so by checking the attestation against its schema. \n\nThey can use the `function getAttestation(bytes32 _attestationId)` to retrieve the attestation details. Then, by examining the retrieved data against the schema, they can verify if the attested knowledge proof is legitimitate according to the PoK criteria.\n\nThis capability of EAS to implement PoK provides an objective, transparent, and cryptographically secure verification method within a decentralized framework, thereby minimizing the odds of any fraudulent claim of knowledge.","x":10679,"y":2757,"width":1068,"height":1110,"color":"6"},

Traditionally, knowledge has been a collective endeavour, spread through various mediums like books, lectures, online posts and discussions. But the issue with these traditional modes is the lack of a transparent, verifiable way to track knowledge dissemination and recognize the originators for their contributions.\n\nProof of Knowledge, in contrast, provides a solution. The idea is simple yet profound, creating a system where knowledge, in the form of data or information, can be registered in a decentralised ledger or blockchain. This registration generates a unique identifier to each piece of information. \n\nWhy is this important? There are a couple of reasons:\n\n1. **Trust and Verification:** Just like with any blockchain-based system, it provides a transparent and immutable record. Any piece of knowledge written in the chain can be traced back to its original author/creator, which significantly increases the trust in the information as it can be verified.\n\n2. **Incentivizing Knowledge Sharing:** In a system integrated with cryptocurrency or tokens, the knowledge provider can be rewarded each time someone uses their information. This could revolutionize industries and systems where knowledge is key, such as research, education, and advisory services.\n\nIn summary, Proof of Knowledge could very well lead to a paradigm shift in how we consider knowledge dissemination and usage. It could incentivize knowledge sharing on a larger scale and create vast, transparent databases of verifiable data. This fits well with the ethos of the digital age, where open collaboration, innovation, and information verification are increasingly crucial.","x":1040,"y":-632,"width":880,"height":919,"color":"6"},

To facilitate the verification and recording process of an Engram within the Proof of Knowledge (PoK) protocol, we need to create a schema that includes all the necessary details about each Engram.\n\nHere's an example schema for the Engram record:\n\n```\n{\n    Schema # : \"Incremental number\",   //This number is auto-assigned & non-unique\n    UID: \"Unique Identifier\",          //This identifier is unique to the engram\n    Creator: \"Creator's wallet address\",  \n    Transaction_ID: \"Ethereum transaction ID\",  //Transaction ID for the engram creation\n    Resolver_Contract: \"Optional contract ID\",  //If any, for complex cases\n    Attestation_Count: \"Number\",       //The number of attestations made on/off chain\n    Schema: {\n        Engram_Title: \"String\",\n        Engram_Description: \"String\",\n        Engram_Creation_Timestamp: \"UNIX Timestamp\",\n        Related_Study_Questions: [\"Array of Study Question UIDs\"],\n        Knowledge_Field: \"String\", //The field of knowledge the Engram pertains \n        Engram_Contributor: \"User ID/Wallet address of the contributor\",\n        Engram_Usage_Metrics: {\n            Frequency_Of_Appearance: \"Number\",\n            Frequency_Of_Selection: \"Number\",\n            Frequency_Of_References: \"Number\",\n            Helpfulness_Rating: \"Float\", //Scale of 1-5\n        },\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis schema clearly and concisely captures all necessary information about each Engram. It records the Engram's title, description, the timestamp of its creation, and its associated Study Questions. It also includes a field indicating which domain of knowledge the Engram falls under. We attribute each Engram to its contributor and track usage metrics to understand how frequently the Engram is appearing and selected, how often it is referenced, and how helpful users find it.\n\n**Note:** This is an initial outline for a schema dedicated to recording an Engram as a proof-of-knowledge. Depending on the specific requirements of your project, this schema could need to be extended or modified. Moreover, don't forget to consider gas efficiency when designing your schema - try to maintain a balance between the level of detail and efficiency.","x":8802,"y":5742,"width":943,"height":913,"color":"6"},

Operating within our blockchain-based architecture, EAS provides a secure, decentralized, and transparent system for verifying and validating various kinds of interactions within our knowledge ecosystem.\n\nSpecifically, within the PoK protocol, the EAS applies to the lifecycle of an Engram or Study Question (SQ). This lifecycle includes the initial creation of Engrams or SQs, stages of value addition, their utilization by various users, and their evolution over time. The EAS authenticates each stage of this process, creating a reliable record of Engram or SQ history and interactions.\n\nWhen an Engram or SQ is first created, it is recorded via an attestation. The creator of the Engram or SQ is also noted through EAS, attesting that they were the original contributor of that knowledge piece. As value is added to this Engram or SQ—be it through more data, insights, revisions, or connections—each change is also captured through an attestation, creating a trail of evolution and accumulation of intellectual input.\n\nAs the Engram or SQ continues to be used among a global network of AI interfaces, each interaction and usage is also documented. These records contribute to an Engram or SQ's ongoing validation in our ecosystem. This evidence-based approach ensures that each Engram or SQ's relevance, accuracy, and utility are continuously verified, evaluated, and updated.\n\nFinally, the Ethereum Attestation Service also lays the groundwork for our incentive mechanism. Each attestation becomes part of the computation determining value attribution and reward distribution. EAS ensures a transparent and fair system where contributors of Engrams or SQs are rewarded based on actual utility and demand in the ecosystem.\n\nIn summary, the use of EAS within the PoK protocol forms a trustworthy and secure system for validating knowledge contributions and rewarding contributors. It answers the call for a distributed, transparent, and reliable method to authenticate, validate, and incentivize meaningful engagements in a decentralized knowledge ecosystem.","x":9952,"y":4981,"width":909,"height":1039,"color":"6"},
