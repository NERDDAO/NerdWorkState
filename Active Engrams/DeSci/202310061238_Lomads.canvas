In these settings, traditional methods of tracking and rewarding efforts often fall short due to the non-hierarchical nature and the usually dispersed and diverse contributor base.\n\nThe protocol uses Soulbound Tokens (SBT) to document a person's digital journey through an organization, covering various milestones, collaborative efforts, completed tasks, and acquired skills). These tokens become a sort of \"digital diary\" providing a detailed record of an individual's input within the organization. \n\nThe system also incorporates role assignment and access control, ensuring that members have appropriate access based on their contributions and held roles. This feature enhances the protocol's security measures and promotes efficient resource utilization based on each member's capabilities. \n\nAdditionally, data captured by the Lomads protocol is not stored in isolation. Instead, it becomes a potential source of insight for developers who can create DApps for in-depth analysis, aiding in everything from candidate sourcing to incentive automation.\n\nThe protocol also allows for seamless integration into organizational frameworks, with any organization able to customize what kinds of contributions it wants to capture and how it wants to capture them.\n\nHowever, such a protocol could also raise concerns regarding data privacy and the potential for manipulation. If an organization doesn't implement strict control parameters or doesn't regulate development thoroughly, it's conceivable that inaccurate or skewed contributions could be registered, which could lead to unintended consequences.\n\nA critique of the protocol might question how truly representative or comprehensive this approach could be in all use cases. While it seems well-suited for tech-based or gaming communities where digital contributions are more prevalent and easier to track, it might prove less effective in other sectors where contributions are more diverse or harder to quantify precisely.\n\nAdditionally, the termination and exit protocols imply that access to acquired or earned assets is cut off when an individual departs a community or organization, represented by revocation of their SBT. There is a mention of issuing an Exit Soulbound Token, but it's unclear if or how previous contributions and rewards are ported over or retained in any form.","x":2124,"y":2865,"width":609,"height":1095,"color":"6"},

Here's a more specific breakdown of the contribution life cycle in the Hyper Knowledge and Contribution Ecosystem (HKCE) using Lomads:\n\n1. **Task Creation:** A task or project is created within the Lomads platform. This is done by an entity or individual who has the authority to assign tasks within the decentralized collective.\n\n2. **Task Acceptance:** A contributor within the collective accepts the task. They then begin working on the task, using the tools and resources provided by the collective.\n\n3. **Contribution Submission:** Once the task is completed, the contributor submits their work. This submission is recorded in the Lomads system.\n\n4. **Validation:** The submission is then validated by the collective. This can be done through a peer review process, or by an appointed validator. The Lomads platform provides tools to facilitate this validation process.\n\n5. **Proof-of-Contribution:** Once the submission is validated, a Proof-of-Contribution is generated. This is a digital record that confirms the contributor's work and its validation.\n\n6. **Tokenization:** The validated contribution is then tokenized. This means that it is converted into a digital asset, represented by tokens on the blockchain. The number of tokens awarded depends on the value of the contribution, as determined by the collective.\n\n7. **Payment:** The contributor is then paid for their work. This payment is made in tokens, which can be exchanged for other forms of value within the collective or on the open market.\n\n8. **Record Keeping:** The entire process, from task creation to payment, is recorded on the blockchain. This provides a transparent and immutable record of the contribution and its value.\n\nIn this way, the HKCE provides a transparent, efficient, and fair process for managing and rewarding contributions within a decentralized collective."},

The contribution is then validated by the collective.\n\n2. **Tokenization & Proof-of-Contribution:** Once validated, the contribution is tokenized, creating a digital asset on the blockchain. A Proof-of-Contribution is generated, confirming the contributor's work and its validation.\n\n3. **Usage Tracking:** The Lomads platform tracks the usage of this contribution in the production of LLM (presumably a product or service). This could be done using smart contracts on the blockchain, which can automatically record every instance where the contribution is used.\n\n4. **Royalty Calculation:** Based on the tracked usage, the system calculates the royalties owed to the contributor. This could be a fixed amount per usage, or a percentage of the value generated by the LLM production.\n\n5. **Royalty Payment:** The calculated royalties are then paid to the contributor in tokens. These tokens can be exchanged for other forms of value within the collective or on the open market.\n\n6. **Transparency & Auditability:** The entire process, from contribution to royalty payment, is recorded on the blockchain. This provides a transparent and immutable record of the contribution, its usage, and the royalties paid. This makes it easy to audit the process and ensure that contributors are fairly compensated for the usage of their knowledge.\n\nIn this way, the HKCE and Lomads platform can be used to pay royalties for knowledge based on the usage of contributions in LLM production and context."}
