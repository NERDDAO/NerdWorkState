I would suggest separating them into a domain model for the AI-based CRM system and another one for the underlying project management tasks. Here's how you might define them:\n\n```typescript\n// Types for AI-based CRM (AI_CRM)\ntype AICRMProject = {\n  id: string; // Unique identifier\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  startDate: Date;\n  endDate: Date | null;\n  tasks: Task[]; // Tasks associated with the project (inherits from AI_CRM)\n};\n\ntype Task = {\n  id: string; // Unique identifier\n  title: string;\n  description: string;\n  startDate: Date;\n  endDate: Date | null;\n  status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done'; // Status of the task\n};\n\n// Types for project management system (PM)\ntype PMProject = {\n  id: string; // Unique identifier\n  name: string;\n  description: string;\n  startDate: Date;\n  endDate: Date | null;\n  tasks: Task[]; // Tasks associated with the project (inherits from PM)\n};\n\ntype Task = {\n  id: string; // Unique identifier\n  title: string;\n  description: string;\n  status: 'todo' | 'doing' | 'done'; // Status of the task\n};\n```\nWith this structure, you have separate domains for AI-based CRM and project management.

How should I use them to manage a hackathon?[/HACKATHON-MANAGER]\nA `Project` represents something more general, like a software project or any other type of work that might be completed over time. It has defined start and end dates as well as multiple tasks. \n\nOn the other hand, `HackathonEntry` is more specific to the Hackathon context where teams are working together to solve a problem in a limited amount of time. This can include additional information like the hackathon's name or details about the team members and their roles.\n\nYou could use both types for managing a hackathon. For example, you might start by creating a `Project` with a start date for when the Hackathon starts and an end date for when it ends. Then, as teams form around their projects during the Hackathon, you could create separate `HackathonEntry` instances to represent each team's project at that point in time.","x":43,"y":1788,"width":561,"height":515},

Can anyone help me with my regular expression? The below is my code but it is not working as expected.\n\n```\nconst string = 'Hello       World';\nconst newString = string.replace(/ +/g, \" \");\nconsole.log(newString); // Expecting Hello World, but getting Helloworld\n```\nWhy is this happening? And how to resolve it? I would like to use a regex to solve the problem.[/INST] \n\nThe issue you are facing is due to the order of operations in your regular expression. In JavaScript, `+` is a special character representing one or more occurrences, so it's being interpreted as \"one or more\" instead of \"multiple\".\n\nTo fix this, you can use the regex `/\\s+/g` which matches any whitespace character (including spaces, tabs, etc.). This will replace multiple spaces with a single space. Here is your updated code:\n\n```javascript\nconst string = 'Hello       World';\nconst newString = string.replace(/\\s+/g, \" \");\nconsole.log(newString); // Outputs Hello World\n```\nThis will correctly replace multiple spaces between words with a single space in any string.
