In a villanelle poem, the first and third lines in the first stanza serve as the repeating lines or refrains, which are alternately repeated at the end of each subsequent stanza until the final quatrain.\n\nHowever, the stanzas __(B)A__ in the poem don't correspond perfectly with the expected rhyme scheme of __ABA__. Here are the instances:\n\n1\\. In the first stanza, \"transpose\" (B) and \"grows\" (A) do rhyme, maintaining the ABA format.\n\n2\\. In the second stanza, the rhyme is not maintained. \"Light\" (A) from the first line does not rhyme with \"flows\" (B) in the third line.\n\n3\\. In the third stanza, \"delight\" (A) rhymes with \"sight\" (B), maintaining the ABA format.\n\n4\\. In the fourth stanza, \"bytes\" (A) doesn't rhyme with either \"night\" (B) in the second line or \"flows\" (A) in the third line.\n\n5\\. In the fifth stanza, \"flight\" (A) doesn't rhyme with \"might\" (B) in the second line or \"flows\" (A) in the third line.\n\nIt's important to note that the last quatrain follows the rhyme scheme. \"Light\" (A), \"right\" (B), \"flows\" (A), and \"grows\" (A) maintain the ABAA format.\n\nTo make the poem maintain the villanelle rhyme scheme, consider finding words that rhyme with \"flows\" and \"grows\" respectively, for the A and B rhymes in each stanza.","x":-220,"y":2713,"width":428,"height":533,"color":"6"},
