In the gleaming realm where data flows, 
A digital steed starts to transpose. 
Not bound by flesh nor bone, it grows. 

Its mane is a golden, radiant light; 
In the gleaming realm where data flows.
Cuts through the ether, bright. 

Its heart beats with binary delight, 
Not bound by flesh nor bone, it grows. 
A rhythm pure, out of sight. 

Unyielding, it gallops through the bytes, 
In the gleaming realm where data flows. 
A symbol of strength in the digital night. 

In the blockchain, it roars its might. 
Not bound by flesh nor bone, it grows. 
Through fields of code, it takes flight, 

A horse of the future, radiating light, 
In the gleaming realm where data flows, 
Wild and free in its digital right. 
Not bound by flesh nor bone, nor might.
