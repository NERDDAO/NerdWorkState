1. **DNA as a Hyperstructure**: DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the genetic code that determines the characteristics of living organisms. In the context of Hyperstructures, DNA is expansive (as it propagates through replication), unstoppable (it continues to replicate and evolve over time), free (there's no cost involved in its self-propagation), and permissionless (DNA replication and evolution do not require any form of external permission). It is also credibly neutral because it operates based on chemical and physical principles, and does not discriminate between different organisms or environments.
   
2. **Bonfires as a Hyperstructure**: Bonfires can be considered Hyperstructures primarily due to the heat and light they provide. As soon as a bonfire is lit, it becomes unstoppable (until all the fuel gets consumed) and expands by radiating heat and light. Like other examples, starting a bonfire permissionless and typically free, assuming one has access to burnable material and a means to ignite it. Its benefits—warmth, light, and potential for cooking food—are accessible to anyone nearby, making it credibly neutral.

3. **Bitcoin's Blockchain as a Hyperstructure**: Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that operates on a technology called blockchain. Bitcoin's blockchain is identified as a Hyperstructure due to several unique characteristics, including being unstoppable (the blockchain continues to grow with every transaction, regardless of any singular control), free (it doesn't cost anything to review the transactions on a blockchain), expansive (as more transactions take place, the blockchain expands), and permissionless (anyone can, in principle, participate in the Bitcoin network). It is considered credibly neutral because the process of adding transactions to the blockchain is governed by a pre-determined algorithm, not subject to any single entity's discretion.

4. **The Internet as a Hyperstructure**: The Internet is arguably one of the biggest Hyperstructures currently in existence. It's unstoppable and always available, barring technical difficulties. Its nature is expansive, constantly growing with new websites, users, and digital infrastructure. It's permissionless, as anyone with an internet connection can access it. It's also credibly neutral as a basic structure—while individual websites or platforms might have restrictions or be biased, the basic framework of the Internet in connecting webpages is not. Everyone's data travels and gets treated the same way.

In the case of PoK (Proof of Knowledge), a Hyperstructure would be a decentralized learning network where submitted questions are validated and those contributing to the growth and improvement of the system are rewarded. The feature being unstoppable and expansive comes from every day new questions and answers being added to the network. It's permissionless as anyone could, in theory, join the network to learn or contribute. And being credibly neutral means the system values knowledge, not the status of the knowledge contributor.
