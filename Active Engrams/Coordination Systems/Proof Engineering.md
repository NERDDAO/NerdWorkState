A Proof Designer is an architect of Hyperstructures. Their goal is to facilitate the construction and deployment of complex systems that embody the principles of unstoppability, freeness, permissionlessness, positivity (creating a positive-sum environment), and credible neutrality.

In their hands, the designing and implementation of the proof about the Hyperstructure's feasibility and potential are realized. 

They operate at the intersection of technological ingenuity and deep understanding of societal systems, harnessing their prowess to create designs that foster equitable, accessible, and efficient structures. By their craft, they metamorphose abstract concepts into tangible reality, shaping systems that may redefine the way society interacts with technology. 

Their work manifests itself in various forms: from designing the algorithm for a new blockchain protocol that operates on hyperstructural principles, to envisaging how natural systems like DNA replication can inspire the creation of resilient and robust Hyperstructures.

Theirs is not a task of mere representation but an endeavor of proof-making, substantiating the existence and benefits of the Hyperstructure they conceive. Subsequently, the proofs they create serve as the foundation upon which Hyperstructures stand: indubitable, irrefutable, and invaluable.
