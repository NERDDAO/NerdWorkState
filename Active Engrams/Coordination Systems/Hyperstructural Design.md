Proofs in the context of hyperstructural design serve not just as logical assertions to affirm the existence or functionality of a system, but as the foundational pilings upon which the hyperstructure is constructed. The characteristics of the proof shape the emergent properties of the consequent hyperstructure, and therefore, proof engineering is a critical process in the design of desired hyperstructures. 

To design hyperstructures that yield the desired emergent properties, proof designers must meticulously engineer the proofs with these properties in mind. Each emergent property of a hyperstructure can be considered as a direct consequence of the underlying proof, in other words, “Proofs manifest Hyperstructures”. 

It is therefore the prerogative of the proof designer to engineer a valid proof that, when implemented, yields the intended emergent properties of the hyperstructure. This is achieved through a deep understanding of the principles laid down, meticulous design, and extensive testing to validate the proof. And once designed and validated, the proofs serve as the recruitable foundation from which the tangible hyperstructures and their emergent properties arise.
