One-Time Upfront Universal Retainer

A _heavily-reduced_ upfront retainer, to be ideally paid in L2 ETH, that covers all contractors, services, tooling costs, & associated resource needs. (This covers TGC, ND, & UX, & also reflects the unique urgency/constrained TAT requested by the client)

$12,500, one time.

Universal Retroactive Performance Pay

Locked to project metric milestones (MC) - this is to be disbursed in the project token. TGC & TND plan to contribute a substantial portion of this sum _directly back into the project LP,_ both for our own purposes & as a display of commitment to project success

**at 10MM MC -** 0.5% of $enjoy supply ﻿﻿﻿﻿**at 25MM MC -** 0.75% of $enjoy supply*﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿_(these %'s are expressed as_ _**totals**_ _- eg, the maximum payout would be 0.5% of supply and then if 25MM MC is met, an additional 0.25%, for a total 0.75% of total $enjoy supply)_

Ongoing Universal Retainer & Ramp-Up of Agreed Services [optional]

Pending successful engagement around this scope, and **solely** at Client's discretion, TGC/ND have worked with Client to ideate some particularly compelling vectors for exponential project growth/iterative enhancement to enjooyer experience. TGC/ND have gone to great lengths to make these experiments/initiatives easy to “turn on” from the fundamental contracts level.﻿  
﻿﻿  
﻿This proposed ongoing universal retainer is representative of expanded services, yet is heavily reduced as a gesture of goodwill/interest, and, depending upon term commitment, is malleable/open to negotiaton.

$18,000, if month to month - reduced on 3, 6, or 12 month contracts.
