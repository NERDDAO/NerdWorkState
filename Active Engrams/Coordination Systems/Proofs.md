Sure, let's discuss some potential proof designs that could give rise to interesting hyperstructures:

1. **Proof of Burn (Proof-of-Burn):** This approach would require participants to "burn" or permanently dispose of a digital asset to earn the right to perform an action or receive another asset. This creation of scarcity could create network effects as the supply of the original asset dwindles.

2. **Proof of Authority (PoA):** A consensus algorithm that assigns validating authority to nodes based on their identified, reputable identities (rather than on the basis of computational power or stake). Such systems could lead to fast and efficient networks as validator-set is curated, which can be particularly beneficial in private or consortium blockchains. 

3. **Proof of Reputation (PoR):** This approach could leverage participants' real-world and on-platform reputation to distribute rights or privileges. Platforms like Steemit, for example, use a form of PoR to allocate voting rights based on contributed value to the platform.

4. **Proof of Activity (PoA):** This is a hybrid approach that combines proof of work and proof of stake. In this system, mining kicks off in a traditional PoW fashion, but the blocks mined do not contain any transactions (these are called templates). Next, the system switches to PoS, where a random validator is chosen to sign off on the block. Completed blocks include a list of several future validators, selected at random. 

5. **Proof of History (PoH):** This approach could create a historical record that proves that an event has occurred at a specific moment in time. Solana blockchain uses PoH for the order of transactions and to decrease the processing power necessary to maintain the network. 

6. **Proof of Weight:** In this system, the influence a node has is proportional to the weight it carries in terms of any specific matrix (could be amount of data held, age on the system, etc.).

Each of these proof mechanisms could create a hyperstructure with unique properties based on what is required as "proof." Different proof types can lead to different network behavior, participant incentives, and ultimately different network effects.
